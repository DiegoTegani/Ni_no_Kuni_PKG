<color:4FF79B>All-Out Attack!</color>
<color:FCA2F0>All-Out Defense!</color>
Don't fret, Ollie-boy! Let youer old pal Drippy<NL>talk you through the basics of battle!
First off, take a look at that <color:#4>green gauge</color> by there.<NL>That shows you youer <color:#4>Health Points (HP)</color>.
The more HP you have, the healthier you are,<NL>but if you run out, you'll go unconscious.
And see the <color:#5>blue gauge</color> underneath that?<NL>That's youer <color:#5>Magic Points (MP)</color>, en't it?
Don't worry about magic for now, mun.<NL>Let's talk about beasties first, shall we?
You can see lots of information about them<NL>up by here, on the right. There's useful, eh?
The <color:#1>red gauge</color> shows you their HP.<NL>Get that down to nothing, and you've won!
And these <color:#1>speech bubble thingies</color> down by<NL>here are the commands you can use in battle.
Well, that's enough to be going on with.<NL>Try giving the rotter a smack with youer stick!
Just use [key_lr] to select "<color:#1>Attack</color>," confirm youer<NL>choice with [btn_ok], and Bob's youer uncle!
Righto! Get cracking with the whacking!
Tidy! Or should I say, <color:#1>Nice!</color>
That's what they say when you find an enemy's<NL>weak spot or block a big attack, see?
Oho! And look at that! It's dropped something!<NL>You'd best pick it up, eh?
That's what's known as a <color:#1>glim</color>, Ollie-boy!<NL>Enemies drop them in the heat of battle.
<color:#4>Green glims</color> like that one you just<NL>grabbed will <color:#4>restore a few of youer HP</color>.
And <color:#5>blue ones give you MP back</color> instead.<NL>Same color as the gauge, see? Tidy!
Oh, and you can also give youer HP and<NL>MP a boost with spells and items, en't it?
'Course, you'll just have to take my word for<NL>that, what with you not having any at the mo...
Okey-doke! That's enough from me—<NL>it's time for you to practice what I preach!
Go on, boy bach! Give 'em what for!
Righto, Ollie-boy! It's time to learn<NL>about fighting with familiars.
First off, you've got to pick who's going to<NL>fight out of you and youer little friend!
We've gone to the trouble of making him, so<NL>we'd best give him a go, eh? Select him, will you?
Tidy! Now let's send him into the fray,<NL>shall we?
Oh yeah. See that circle in the top left there?<NL>That's youer familiar's <color:#1>stamina gauge</color>.
What that does is, it <color:#1>shows you how<NL>much longer he can fight for</color>, see?
The longer you keep him on the go, the<NL>shorter his stamina gauge will get.
When it's empty, that means the pooer lad's<NL><color:#1>so tired, he can't fight anymore</color>. Tragic, eh?
So before that happens, you have to call<NL>him back to you for a bit of a rest, like.
Oh, and there's something else about<NL>familiars you should know...
See this little mark by here?<NL>That's his <color:#1>sign</color>.
It's sort of like a star sign, except there's<NL>only four of them: Sun, Moon, Star, and Planet.
And like star signs, <color:#1>different ones get on<NL>better</color>. You can use that to help you in battle.
Next, let's talk about <color:#1>tricks</color>. They're proper<NL>powerful abilities, a bit like youer spells.
And <color:#1>just like spells, they cost MP to use</color>.<NL>You can see the cost written next to them.
But what you've got to remember is that<NL><color:#1>you and youer familiars share MP and HP</color>.
So if a familiar uses a trick or takes a<NL>big hit, it's youer MP or HP that'll suffer.
Crikey, this is a long old lesson, eh?<NL>Right, let's finish with a top tip, shall we?
Youer familiar's stamina is always going down,<NL>so <color:#1>you'll need to swap with him regularly</color>.
You can do that anytime you like by<NL>pressing [btn_l1], en't it?
Now, I'm going to stop talking before I put<NL>us both to sleep.
It's youer turn to sing for youer supper!<NL>Go on, boy bach!
Knickers! This looks serious, Ollie-boy!<NL>You'd best defend youerself!
You've seen the "<color:#1>Defend</color>" command, en't it?<NL>Use it, or youer in for a proper headache, mun!
En flipping garde!
<color:#1>Nice</color> one, Ollie-boy! There's tidy!
Defending against big moves like that<NL>can earn you a <color:#1>nice</color> little bonus as well.
So when he starts building up a nasty-looking<NL>number, be sure to put up youer guard!
Tidy! That's a <color:#1>gold glim</color>, mun! That little<NL>beauty'll <color:#1>restore all youer HP</color> for you!
And not only that, it'll also let you do a <color:#1>Miracle Move</color> that doesn't use any MP! Tidy!
But they don't hang around forever—<NL>hurry up and grab it, Ollie-boy!
At last—double the familiars, double the fun!<NL>And double the possibilities!
To swap between youer familiars, just<NL>press [btn_l1], and then pick one with [key_lr].
That's simple enough even for you, en't it?<NL>Tidy, let's get to it then, shall we?
Now you and Esther can fight together, mun!<NL>Double trouble! Tidy!
Now there's two of you, you can pick <color:#1>who<NL>leads</color> when a battle starts by pressing [btn_l1] or [btn_r1].
Why don't you give it a go, eh?<NL>Go on, pick Esther!
Now Esther's in charge instead, see?<NL>She's what's called the <color:#1>leader</color> now.
And the leader can boss everybody around.<NL>See the "<color:#1>Tactics</color>" command down by there?
Pick it, and you can tell all youer butties<NL>what you want them to do. Easy-peasy!
And to <color:#1>change leaders mid-battle</color>, just press<NL>[btn_l1], followed by a little tap on the old [key_ud]!
Now get out there and enjoy being a<NL>gruesome twosome!
Right, listen! There's three creatures here.<NL>You have to pick one to be your new familiar.
You know how to tame a creature, don't you?<NL>First you have to <color:#1>beat it in battle</color>.
These ones are friends of mine, so I've told<NL>them not to fight back when you bash them.
Well? Come on—beat up the creature that<NL>you want to be your new best friend!
Right then, daughter of Rashaad—<NL>are you ready?
You're the only one who can use that harp.<NL>You'd better try it out, hadn't you?
Ha! Look at that!<NL>It's up on its feet again!
Creatures do that sometimes when<NL>you beat them in battles.
See those yucky <color:#1>pink hearts</color> over its head?<NL>They mean you can tame it!
If Esther's near a creature with hearts<NL>over its head, she can use her [cnd_love] command.
Then she can choose whether to play a <color:#1>serenade</color><NL>to tame it, or let it go back into the wild.
But if you don't choose quickly,<NL>it'll run off anyway.
I've told these ones not to run away because<NL>you're beginners and you're probably rubbish.

Get a move on, Ollie-boy!
Slow down, Mr. Drippy!
Haa, haa...
But Ding Dong Dell's just down the way!
Hm?
Whoa!
What do we do?
Huh—
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!! Nnngh...
Run for i— Aaaaaahhh!
Right, let's get going, shall we?
Huh!?
Hey, wait for me!
So this is...
...your world.
That's right! A whole 'nother world.<NL>Beautiful, en't it?
<KEEP>

eva0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Haa, Haa...
Sorry, Mister!
G'morning, Miss Leila!
Why, good morning, Oliver.
Your groceries are over there, honey.
Thanks!
Oh, I almost forgot—
Did Philip find you?<NL>He said he had something to show you, dear.
R-Really!?
So he finally finished it, huh...
Do you know where he is right now?
He just stepped out with some deliveries for me.
I doubt he'll have gotten far.
Thanks, Miss Leila!
Oh! Say "hi" to your mother for me!
Sure thing, Miss Leila!

eva0025_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hey! Ollie!
Over here!
(Oh, it's Phil!)

eva0026_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Good thing you found me. Guess what?<NL>She's finally ready!
So what Miss Leila said—is it really what I think it is?
What else would it be, dumb-dumb?
Boy, you are somethin' else, Phil!<NL>So what do we do now?
What else? We take her for a spin! Tonight!
Wh— Tonight!? But I can't...<NL>I mean, I need to ask my mom, and...
Sure, sure, you go ask your ma.<NL>And then when do we do it, huh? Tomorrow? Next year?
Well, I... No, but...
Okay, we'll do it tonight!<NL>But we'll have to be real quiet...
Sure we will!
Okay, tonight at my garage!<NL>Be there or be square!
Sure!
So, this is the child who will save the world?
<KEEP>
Or so says the crystal ball, Your Radiance.
Hmm... And the Dark Djinn's power alone<NL>will not suffice...?
I fear not.
What is the child's name?
Oliver, Your Radiance.
Oliver...

eva0030_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So this is the child who will save the world?
Indeed, Your Radiance.<NL>...If the crystal ball is to be believed.
And the Dark Djinn's power alone<NL>will not suffice...?
I fear not.
What is the child's name?
Oliver, Your Radiance.
Oliver...

Hey, Mom. I got the groceries!
Thanks, sweetie!<NL>Just pop them on the table, will you?
<KEEP>
Say, Mom...
Hm? Did you say something, sweetie?
You're kinda busy tomorrow, huh...?
Well, now that you mention it, I do have to practice for my concert in the morning.
Oh yeah?<NL>So...you'll be in bed kinda early, huh?
Hm?
Yes, I suppose I will.
Oh, you will, huh?
Will you stop being so mysterious and<NL>eat your breakfast?
You'll be late for school.
Om nom nom...
And chew before you swallow...
(gulp)
Thanks for breakfast, Mom!
See you later, Mom!
Bye, sweetie! You be good, now!
I will!

eva0041_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hey, Phil!<NL>You didn't go to school yet?
Ha! School schmool!<NL>Today's a special day, kiddo!
Today's the day our dream machine finally rolls off of the drawing board and onto the streets of Motorville!
Oh boy! I can't wait!<NL>When can I see it?
Whoa there, cowboy! Not so loud!<NL>Don't forget this is our secret.
...Hey, dumb-dumb!<NL>You didn't tell your mom about it, did you?
No I did not! I asked her if she was busy, and she said she has a concert practice, so she'll be in bed real early!
Perfect. Then tonight's the night!
You still in, kiddo?
Sure I am!<NL>Tonight, at your garage! I'll be there!

eva0045_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oliver...<NL>So this is the boy who will save the world?
Such a fragile, fleeting glimmer.
For the promised one, he does not seem that promising, milady.
Yet one should not underestimate the potential humans such as he possess.
Just as the Dark One blanketed everything in darkness, the light will blind all in its brightness.
What is your intention, Your Majesty?
We must nip this in the bud.
Understood, milady.<NL>Immediately.
You who would save a dying world...
Meet thy death!

eva0049_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
She must be asleep by now...
......
Neato!<NL>She's out like a light!
Now's my chance!<NL>I have to get to Phil's garage!

eva0050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...
Hey!
In here!
What're you lookin' at?
What is it with that kid?
What kept you, slowpoke?
Sorry! My mom just wouldn't go to bed.
So, is it finished?
Sure is.
The last bearing's in, and she's primed for action!
Wanna see?
Do I ever!
All right...
Here goes nothin'...
Okay!
「ワ～ッ」
Oh, is this neat!
Phil, this is so, so neat!
You betcha.
It's soooooo neat!
The new Coupe D-Lux ain't got nothin' on us, Ollie!
It's not even close!
So, you ready to hit the road, kiddo?
Yeah!
Ha ha!

eva0065_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Okay! There's nobody around—we should take her outside now!
So, uh...Phil... Who gets to drive first?
Huh?<NL>Hmm... Lemme see now...
Tell you what, kiddo—if you run down the street and make sure the coast is clear, I'll let you go first!
You mean that? Oh boy, oh boy!<NL>O-Okay, wait right here!
And watch out for Starey Mary, will ya?
Starey Mary?
Y'know, the girl who was spying on us before. I swear, that kid is cracked.
See? There she is again!<NL>I'll bet that tattletale goes straight to her olds!
She wouldn't do that...
What are you, sweet on her or something?<NL>Go check out front already!
Sure thing, Phil!<NL>I'll be right back!

eva0070_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Haa, haa...
All right!
The coast is clear!
I better go tell Phil—
Don't go!
…っ！？
Wh—Huh?
It's bad! Please, Oliver... Don't go!
<KEEP>
Huh!? Who—Who are you?<NL>How do you know my name?
Ollie!
What's takin' you so long?
I'm sorry, Phil, someone saw me...
Aww, man! Who was it?
Oh, uh...
That girl over...
Huh?
What're you talkin' about?<NL>There's nobody there.
...Huh? That's weird...<NL>She was right there... A girl...
A girl, huh? I bet it was that dumb Starey Mary!<NL>Oh no... Couldn't be. She's not allowed out.
Mm-hmm.
You must be goin' screwy or somethin'.
Anyway, c'mon!
O-O-Okay...

eva0075_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oliver...
"The boy who will save the world..."
But unfortunately for him, his light is yet<NL>a mere candle in the blackness.
<KEEP>
Indeed.
He may be the child the prophecies speak of,<NL>but he is a child nonetheless.
Yet these humans can be...disturbingly powerful.
Did the other's darkness not engulf the land entirely?<NL>Might this one not prove equally...tenacious?
What would you have me do, Your Radiance?
Such saplings must not be suffered to grow.
Very well, Your Radiance...
He who would save this doomed world...
...must die!

eva0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Mom! Help me!
Huh!? (sigh)
Ah!

It's Ollie—!
Oliver!
Oliver! Wake up!
M... Mom...
Oh sweetie, I'm so glad you're okay!
I'm sorry, Mom...
I'm sorry...

Don't be silly, Phil. What about your car?
That hunka junk? I can make another one in no time!
Well, I think you two have had quite enough<NL>excitement for one day.
Yes, Ma'am.
...Yah!
Are you okay, Phil?
Musta twisted my ankle back there...
Whatever will you children get up to next?
Ah! Nnngh...
Allie!
Are you okay?
Mom, what's wrong!?
Nnnggh...

Sentimental fool...sacrificing herself to save her child.
And yet thanks to her, the boy lives...
Of course.
But shorn of his mother's love,<NL>to whom can he now turn for guidance?
And soon he will come to our world,<NL>where our powers are strongest.

Oh, it's so sad.
He's been in there three whole days now.

Curse lifted, is it?
Tidy! I'm free! Freee!

You just witnessed the rebirth of Drippy,<NL>Lord High, er, Lord of the Fairies!

Um...
Who?
What are you, deaf or something?
Drippy, Lord High Lord of the Fairies, I said, didn't I?
"Drippy"...
That's right, and I'm sick to the teeth of youer sniveling and moaning! A proper Cry-Baby Bunting, you are!
Three days, mun!
I mean, I've been sad before,<NL>but crying for three whole days?
I'm surprised there's a drop of water left in you!<NL>Youer a big boy, mun, three days is...well, it's unheard of!
Wha—?
I, uh...
Oh dear! Bit flummoxed, are we?<NL>Bit lost for words?
Not to worry, mun! I've got all the answers!<NL>Oh, but, er...
Prepare youerself—explaining all this is going to take a while. Ready?
Uh-huh...
Tidy!
I like youer style! Very honest, en't you?
Stay that way, okay? Take you far, it will.
On with the show!
Uh... Okay.
See, it's like this, see... What it is is, there's more worlds out there than this one by here.
There's what you might call "parallel worlds," see?<NL>They're like worlds along by the side of youer one.
And one of those worlds is my world.
That's right, a whole 'nother world!
Another world...?
There's quick, you are!
And I—that is the Lord High Lord of the Fairies—<NL>the reason I'm by here in this world of youers...
...Well, it's because there's a proper bad apple trying to upset the peace of both ouer worlds, see?
Shadar, the Dark Djinn, his name is.<NL>
And what he did was, he took over people's hearts...
...and spread war and ruin all over ouer world.
Tried to stand up to him, I did, and he turned me into a flipping doll...
...and kicked me out of ouer world and into youers, the rotter!
And then you went and cried all over me and—poof!—<NL>the curse was lifted, just like that!
Which makes me think you must be the one<NL>we fairies call the Pure-Hearted One!
The one the legends say will save ouer world!
Just goes to show, you can't judge a book by its cover, eh?
So, anyway, that means I'd better get you over to ouer world and have you get rid of Shadar for us. All right with you?
Me?
But how can I—?
Don't fret, mun! It's a big responsibility, I know,<NL>but you'll be all right!
'Specially with me to help you!
But I—
Oh, want me to ask properly, do you? Fair dos.
Wh—?
O, Pure-Hearted One, will you please<NL>come and save ouer world?
No.
Sorry, I must have misheard you—what did you say!?<NL>Go on—once more, but louder...
I won't do it...
I, I mean...
I can't do it.
This is why they say never work with children!
I ask nicely, and you give me a hearty "Yes, Sir!"
That's how this works, see?
"Gee-whiz, that would be swell," you say!
It's just how these things are done!<NL>It's tradition!<NL>
How am I supposed to work with this!?<NL>It's like he's never read a story in his life!<NL>
But I don't know anything about your world.
And...I just can't right now.
What, because youer mam dropped dead?
Uh...
Yeah...
You got a photo of her?
Hurry up, will you? I haven't got all day!
O-Okay.
Let's see now...
Blimey!
It can't be!
But then it can't be a coincidence, neither...
What is it?
The Great Sage Alicia...
Then we might just be able to save youer mam!
What are you talking about?
You ready for another earful?
Yeah!
The souls of people in youer world and my world<NL>are connected.
Which means people from over by here have another version of themselves over by there called a soul mate, see?
And people with soul mates can even look like each other.
Now, youer mam, well, she shared a soul with<NL>the Great Sage Alicia. A proper talent, she was...
Huh? So my mom was a sage...?
But...how does that help us save her?
Well, Alicia tried to take on the Dark Djinn.
But his power was too much for her, and he<NL>trapped her in this dark jewel called the Soulsnare.
When that happened, then the link between hers and youer mam's souls would've been cut off.
But if you could free Alicia, it just might fix the link, and who knows—it might even bring youer mam back!
Is that really true?
I can't be sure now, but it's possible, yeah.
Wait...
How do you know all this, Mr. Drippy?
You've been a doll this whole time...
Ah, now there's clever of you! Good question, lad!
It's like this, see: I'm not the only fairy.
Even though I was stuck by here, my butties were keeping me abreast of all the goings-on over there.
How? I s'pose it's what you might call telepathy.
And that's not all.
I was sending my lordly orders back over there, too.
Having them spy on Shadar and that, you know...
Tidy, eh?
Hm? What is it?
I'll...
I'll do it. I'll come to your world.
I'll come with you and save my mom!
Ohh, there's marvelous!
You might be doing it for all the wrong reasons, but if it saves ouer world, I won't look a gift horse in the mouth!
Tidy! We'd better get going, then. Chop, chop!
Okay!
But...how do we get to your world?
Ohh, curious, are we?
All right, I'll tell you.
First thing we need is a drop of magic.
Go and have a dig around in the fireplace.<NL>There's something hidden there so nosy parkers won't find it.
But why would anybody hide something in there?
That's for me to know and you to find out!<NL>Look lively!

eva0151_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tidy!<NL>Right, magicking ouer way over to my world, is it?
Hmm... Now let's see...
What is it?
You got a wand somewhere by here?
We can't go casting spells without a wand now, can we?
A wand? Why would we have a wand?
Oh. That's a pain. Ah well, can't be helped.
We'll just have to look for one outside.
Huh?
We won't find one out there either.
Don’t nitpick, Cry-Baby Bunting!
"Bunting"?
My name is Oliver! O-li-ver!
Ah, so the cry-baby bit was right at least, was it?
Grrr...

eva0155_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Righto! Time to find ouerselves a magic wand!
You mean there's one hidden somewhere around here? Like the spellbook?
Ha! Youer having a laugh if you think I'm going to make it that easy, mun! What do you think I am?<NL>Made of wizarding equipment!?
No, this one's going to be a little more difficult. But ouer journey over to my world is a hunt for the Soulsnare, among other things...
So why don't you treat this as a warm-up? The Easter egg hunt before the wild goose chase, if you will.
The...huh...?<NL>Um, okay. I guess...
...Okay, I'm lying. The thing is is, I never brought a wand with me.
I mean, look at me! The price of my lovability is my small stature, en't it?
I only just managed to carry that flipping book, mun!<NL>Any more and I'd've been crushed!
So even fairies tell lies, huh...
'Course they do! Us fairies are incorrigible liars! Anyway, no point crying over spilled milk—let's find ouerselves a substitute, shall we?
A substitute? How can there be a substitute for a<NL>magic wand?
Well, if you can find something <color:#1>brown and sticky</color>—like maybe a stick—we might just be able to muddle through.
Uh, okay...<NL>You're sure a stick will work?
Do you think I'm sending you up the garden path or something? Fine! I'll give you a hand. Follow me, Bunting!

eva0160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
(sigh) It's no use. There's nothing around here that looks like a wand...
Youer not wrong, Bunting. All right, we'd better split up, then. Broaden the search, like.
I'll go and take another quick look round youer house. You stay by here and head up the outside search, okay?
Uh, okay...
Okay... Brown and sticky, brown and sticky...
Oliver...
Huh?
Oh, it's you...

Hey! Where did you go?
Ollie-boy!
Why you talking to thin air?
Mr. Drippy!
She disappeared again!
Huh? Who did?
That strange girl...
That's the second time she tried to talk to me...
What's that? A girl? Where?
Youer right about strange—<NL>I can't see her any-flipping-where!
Well, how could you?<NL>She disappeared into thin air!
Well, anyway...
There's something I want to ask you.
There is?
Uh, sure, go ahead.
Do you mind it, you know...having a sidekick, like?
Huh? A sidekick? Who do you mean?
Crikey, there's cold!
"Who do you mean?" he says!
Why not stab me in the heart while youer at it!
I mean me!
I wanted to know if it was all right me joining you on youer adventures, or if you were maybe wanting to trade me in...
...for a younger, prettier model!
But it looks like I got my answer, eh?
Well, so you know, if you don't have faith in people, you'll never see their true worth, and what's more—
Look at this!
...Huh!?
It was on the ground...right where that girl was standing...
Chuck it here, then.
Ta!
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!
It's a wand!
You mean it? A real wand?
Come over by here and take a look, mun.
It might seem like any old stick,<NL>but it's got all magic writing on it, see?
It does, huh? Wow!<NL>Is that how people write in your world?
The runes are all faded, so it might've lost a bit of power...
But, for ouer current purposes, it's a beauty!
Neato!
What a stroke of luck!
Luckier than you know, Ollie-boy.<NL>Duw... I never thought we'd actually find one...
Do you think...maybe that girl brought it here for me?
Right! Now we need a place to cast ouer spell!
To cast <color:#8>Gateway</color>, you'll need somewhere proper massive.
You need space to give it oomph, see?
Do we really need that much...oomph?
Gah, what kind of question is that? Magic is special, en't it? It's sacred, right?
You have to cast spells in the best environment possible.
You really are new to this, en't you? This is beginner stuff we're talking about here!
Oh. Uh...sorry...
Now, take me somewhere with plenty of space.<NL>There's got to be somewhere round by here.
Uh...the town square, I guess.

eva0180_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Do you really think we should be doing this here?
No worries, mun.
Normal people can't see magic, see?
Go on, Ollie-boy—cast Gateway!
Umm...

eva0210_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Jeepers...
That's it mun, you've got it!
(gasp)
Oooh!
Go on, boy bach!
Aaah!
Tidy!
What is it?
Stop that, now! Heel, boy, heel!
Told you, they didn't notice a thing!
Here.
Let's get a-shunting, Cry-Baby Bunting!
For the last time, it's Oliver!
Eh, it's not bad work for a cry-baby, this!
Uh...
Wow...
And we're off to another world!
Hey, wait!
<KEEP>
Wait for me!

eva0220_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Jeepers...
What is this place?
Aaah!
This way, Ollie-boy, come on!
C-Coming!
La-la, la-la, laaa!
Mr. Drippy! Wait for meee!
Boingy boingy boing!
(Out of breath noises.)
Welcome to my world, Ollie-boy!
A whole 'nother world, completely different from youers...
<KEEP>
Another world...

evb0005_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!! Nnngh...
Right, let's get going, shall we?
Huh!?
Hey, wait for me!
Haa, haa...
So this is...
...your world.
Huh!? Hey, wait for me!
Ahh, home at last!
But there's a tidy way to go yet...
Hey, Mr. Drippy...
That was pretty neat just now, huh?
Oh, that herd of ulk? Enjoy youer first encounter with the majestic wildlife of ouer mysterious world, did you?
<KEEP>
Uh-huh!
Huh?
Jeepers...
(HOWL!!!)
Oh, knickers! Where did he spring from?
What do we do!?
He's not like the big softies just now.
He's itching for a fight! Proper savage!
Let's run away!
Nah, use that stick you got by there!
Give him a whacking and send him packing!
Wh— Huh!? Ohhhhhhhhhhhh!?
Look lively, he's making his move!

evb0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Wahey! Proper tidy!<NL>Nice one, Ollie-boy!
Jeepers creepers...
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention—ouer world is absolutely riddled with beasties!
<KEEP>
But keep that up, and you'll have nothing to worry about!
Right, let's get a move on, shall we?
Sure, Mr. Drippy!
But...where are we going?
Well, first off, we need to get you a wand.
But I already have a wand.
Youer having a laugh, en't you?<NL>That thing's about as magical as a flipping cabbage!
You might just squeeze a Gateway spell out of it,<NL>but you can forget about anything more than that.
Honestly, I wish you'd think before you open youer mouth!
Oh... Sorry...
Now, I told you Ding Dong Dell was<NL>just over by yonder, didn't I?
Well, if we're very lucky, we might find a wand with a bit more oomph down by there.
So...are wands really so hard to find here?
Well, time was you couldn't move for the flipping things...
...but since Shadar showed up, magic's taken a real nosedive.
He banned people from using it, see?<NL>Cursed anyone who tried to.
He scared them all so much they gave it up.
So... He's pretty scary, huh...
Well, he turned me into a flipping doll, didn't he!?
Just saying his name's enough to make most folks brick it!
Still, I'd rather be a doll than have him go poking<NL>round in my heart. No one wants to be brokenhearted.
Brokenhearted? Like...sad?
Worse than that—much worse!
It's when he steals a piece of a person's heart. Pooer beggars don't know whether they're alive or dead!
That's no way to live, mun...
So that's why they're all so scared of him, huh?<NL>We can't let him go on doing this.
Well, it's not a matter of letting him, is it?
It's not like people flipping enjoy it!<NL>That's why I brought you here, en't it?
You might just be able to stop him, see?
You really think I can...?
'Course you can!
Youer the Pure-Hearted One!
And the legends say that the Pure-Hearted One<NL>will drive away the darkness!
We'll teach you a few tasty spells,<NL>and you'll be ready to face him in no time!
Sound good to you?
...Okay, I'll do it.
I'll learn magic.
'Course you will!<NL>And that's why we need to find you a better wand!
All right! Let's head for Ding Dong Dell!
Tidy!

evb0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Looks to me like a classic case of brokenheartedness.
"Brokenheartedness..."? You mean that thing you were talking about before?
<KEEP>
That's right.
The brokenhearted are people who've<NL>had part of their hearts stolen.
Pooer souls just aren't themselves... <NL>Go all weird and useless, they do...
So his heart was broken by...?
Keep up, will you? Shadar, en't it! If anyone tries to stand up to him, or does anything he doesn't like...
...he breaks their hearts into pieces so they can't<NL>put up a fight!
Jeepers...
But...if he stays that way, we can't get into Ding Dong Dell!
Then you'd better cure him, en't it, Ollie-boy?<NL>It's time to mend youer first broken heart!
Mend it? But how do I do that?
Well, you can't do it just yet.<NL>There's a couple of things we'll be needing first...
But I know an old man who's got just what we need! Proper useful, I am, eh?
An old man? What old man?
What do you mean, "What old man?" THE old man, en't it! Lives in a wood to the north of here. Proper deep and deeply dark, it is!
That's why they call it the Deep Dark Wood!
Makes sense, I guess...

evb0030_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look at that!<NL>It's a <color:#1>waystone</color>! There's useful!
A waystone?
Yeah, mun. They're these ancient stones, see? You can use them to <color:#1>store a record of youer adventures so far</color>.
In wild places like forests and so on, you can't just plonk youerself on the nearest rock and write youer story down.
But why not?
"Why not?" he says... Give me strength, mun! Because they're crawling with horrible beasties, en't it?
They are? That sounds kinda scary...
You'll get used to it, mun. Just remember: you can't go recording youer progress any old where.
Which is why you should stop at every waystone you see and make good use of it. Better safe than sorry, en't it?
Sure, Mr. Drippy!
Tidy! That's what I like to hear!<NL>Let's hope youer as good as youer word!
Righto! Next stop, the Old Man of the Woods!

evb0040_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Bom-bo, bom-bo, bom! La-la, laaa!
よいしょ よいしょっと<NL>こっちやこっちや
Mr. Drippy! Wait for me!
Ahh! Uh! (He trips over.)
「うっく、うっと」
「ふっ、はぁ・・・」
「うあっ！いたっ・・・」
...Jeepers.
Ollie-boy, meet Old Father Oak!
「うわあ…」
Who goes there?
How do, Youer Leafiness?
Oh, Drippy. It's you.<NL>And to what do I owe the pleasure?
<KEEP>
Well, I've got a visitor by here from another world, see?
And what it is is, I was wondering if you<NL>might lend us a bit of a hand, like.
Oh, I should have known.
You only ever come to see me when you are in need.
Sorry, Youer Tallship. You know I'm always very grateful.
...Hmmm? This boy...
Ah, spotted it, did you, Youer Barkship?
Well, well. The Pure-Hearted One...
He who will drive out the darkness...
And Drippy, you mean to...?
That's right, Youer Ancientship—<NL>we're off to give Shadar a right royal hiding!
You...? Why... Ha ha ha ha ha!<NL>As reckless as ever, I see.
Very well. You shall have my aid.
But first, we had better give the boy<NL>a familiar, had we not?
Oh yeah. Clean forgot, I did!
He's right, Ollie-boy.
It might be a bit early, but I suppose we'd better<NL>teach you how to conjure up familiars, en't it?
"Familiars"?
Yeah, familiars.
Here in ouer world, you can magic up little fighting creatures from youer heart, see? They're called familiars.
Where we're going, the beasties are only going to get bigger and meaner, so youer going to need a helping hand.
Or claw, or beak, or...tentacle...
Can I really do it?
Well, there's only one way to find out.<NL>You want to help youer mam, don't you?
Uh... Sure I do.
Well then, grab youer Wizard's Companion,<NL>and turn to the page marked "Form Familiar"!
But Mr. Drippy...there's no spell named<NL><color:#8>Form Familiar</color> here...
You what!?
The boy is correct. Look at his Wizard's Companion...
It would seem that it is missing more than a few<NL>of its pages.
Really? Knickers!
So does that mean I can't cast the spell?
Ho ho ho! I am not as powerless as all that, young man!
Oliver, was it? Let me see now...<color:#8>Form Familiar</color>... Ahh, yes.
A gift from me to you, young Oliver.
Thank you very much, Old Father Oak!
But simply possessing the page for a particular spell is no guarantee that you will be able to make use of it.
Some spells are simply not meant for certain wizards.<NL>Such is life...
Don't worry about that for now, mun.<NL>Just give <color:#8>Form Familiar</color> a go, will you?
Sure thing, Mr. Drippy!

evb0070_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Jeepers...
What's this...?
That's tidy work, Ollie-boy! Look at that!<NL>A warrior from youer very own heart—a familiar!
<KEEP>
This is a familiar?
That's right!
The fighting spirit inside you made flesh!<NL>A soldier of youer soul!
(The mite makes a noise.)
And he can really help me fight?
Ooh!
Oooh!
Gee...
Mm mm mm! (Gestures to Oliver with his sword.)
Huh?
(Hits Oliver on the head with his sword..)
Ouch!
Bwow!
That was a mean trick!
And the stronger you get,<NL>the harder he's going to hit, as well!
(Nods.) Bwow!
Huh...

evb0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So this is a familiar, huh...?
Bwow!
And he'll be coming with us?
Indeed he will, Ollie-boy! The more the merrier, en't it? Here, you'd better give the little fellow a name, eh?
Oliver... We cannot let you set off into the wild with only that withered wand in your hand.
Let me give you some spells to aid you in battle. The first is the restorative incantation known as <color:#8>Healing Touch</color>.
Tidy! That's the most useful spell there is for a wandering adventurer! Cuts, bruises, sprains, gashes, all gone in a jiffy with Healing Touch!
Gee, you make it sound like I'm going to get hurt an awful lot, Mr. Drippy...
Next, I give you the gift of the blazing inferno.<NL><color:#8>Fireball</color>...
Shoots a little ball of fire, that one does! Plant-based beasties flipping hate fire, mun! Even old Treeface here is scared of Fireball!
Drippy! How dare you! You would never aim such a spell at me, would you, boy?
Golly! Of course not, Old Father Oak!
(Growl)
Uh-oh!
Huh?
Spoiling for a fight, is it?
Better give him what he wants, Ollie-boy!
Huh? But what do I do?
Just...think what you want him to do, and he'll do it.
It's as easy as falling off a log, mun!
Okay.
Just think what I want him to do...
Here goes!

evb0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So now you know how to fight with a familiar, en't it, Ollie-boy!
To be a true contender, you'll need to learn when to let youer familiar loose, and when to take control youerself.
I'll do my best, Mr. Drippy!
Oh, and when he's not fighting, the little fellow can be found taking it easy in the <color:#1>Creature Cage</color>.
The Creature Cage. Got it. I promise to look after him real well, Mr. Drippy!
Oh, I almost forgot. We had something we wanted to ask you, Youer Trunkiness.
There's a guard down in Ding Dong Dell, and he's brokenhearted, see?
Hmm... Brokenhearted, you say?<NL>Shadar's evil spreads still further...<NL>So you will be needing...
That we will, Youer Oakitude! There's quick, you are! ...You have still got it, en't you?
Ho ho ho! Patience, young Drippy. Of course I have!<NL>Let me see now...
Hmm...<NL>I know it's here somewhere...
Crikey! You've not gone and lost it, have you!?
Hm! Lost it? The insolence! I put it away safely among my uppermost branches... It's just a little tangled up there, that's all...
Ah. While I seek it out, I have a favor to ask of you.
Wh— I did mention we're in a flipping hurry, didn't I?<NL>We haven't got time to go—
Mr. Drippy! We should help Old Father Oak!<NL>He gave us those spells, didn't he?
Ahh, how very refreshing to meet such a responsible and honest young man!
All right, all right, I get the flipping message!<NL>Go on—what is it you need us for?
Well...it's the guardian of these woods, you see...
The guardian, eh? What's up with the old fellow?
I am afraid he has become rather...unruly of late.<NL>And he is neglecting his duties.
Well, well, well, that's no good, is it?<NL>We'd better help you sort him out then, eh?
The guardian? He sounds kinda tough...
Too right he is! He's way stronger than youer average beastie! But you've got a familiar on youer side now, mun! You'll be fine!
And besides—if youer going to take down Shadar, you can't back out of a bit of light guardian-bashing now,<NL>can you?
...Okay. I'll do it!
How very kind of you. The guardian can be found in the deepest part of the wood, beyond the <color:#1>Whispering Waterfalls</color>. I wish you luck.

evb0105_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I'd best warn you, Ollie-boy—it's absolutely crawling with monsters beyond here. Careful you don't get got before you even get to the guardian, eh?
I'll be fine, Mr. Drippy! I have a familiar to help me now!
There's brave, you are! Don't forget, though—if the going gets tough, don't be afraid to cast <color:#8>Healing Touch</color>!
I sure won't!
And remember what old Treeface told you:<NL>the <color:#1>Spells Menu</color> is a mere tap of [btn_squ] away!
You should try to familiarize youerself with the<NL><color:#1>Main Menu</color>, too, while youer at it.
Don't worry—youer not going to break anything no matter what you press, so have a good old poke around, en't it?
And when you learn new skills and that, new options will come up on the Main Menu. So keep youer eyes peeled, and make the most of youer new toys!
Jeepers. There's so much to remember...
You'll soon get used to it all, mun! No worries! Now, past the <color:#1>Whispering Waterfalls</color>, and on to the Guardian of the Woods we go!
Right!<NL>Let's go help him get back to normal!

evb0120_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hold up, Ollie-boy!
Huh? What is it?
Listen, mun!<NL>Someone's coming!
But I don't—
It's him! It's the flipping Guardian!
Ngh! Aaaaaaaaah!
(gasp) Huh?

evb0122_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Crikey, that was a close-run thing, mun!
The Guardian... He headed toward the deepest part of the wood... Do you think he's back to normal now?
Youer guess is as good as mine, mun. But that weird look in his eyes had gone, at least.
I reckon he'll probably take some time out to get his head together, and then it'll be right back to the old guardianing!
But what made him go all screwy like that?<NL>You don't think it was...
'Course it flipping was! Had Shadar written all over it! We'd best watch ouer backs if we visit any more forests. Saying that, you get guardians everywhere...
Anyway, we did what we came to do. We'd best get back and see old Treeface, eh?
Sure! Let's go!

evb0130_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hmm!<NL>You did well to calm the Guardian of the Woods.
<KEEP>
And I found what I was looking for...<NL>But first, a gift, by way of thanks.
Gee!
Youer on a roll by here, mun!
I entrust to you one of my closest companions:<NL>The Telling Stone.
His knowledge of our world rivals even my own.<NL>I thought he might help you on your journey.
I'm sure if you ask him nicely, he will tell you anything you wish to know.
And the other thing...the Locket—<NL>this is what you came here for, is it not?
It is a vessel for fragments of the human heart...
To rescue the heartbroken, you will need the Locket and the spells required to use it.
I will give you those as well.
Thank you so much, Old Father Oak!
Hmm! Such a well-mannered child!
...Unlike some I could mention.
Wh— I— All right, all right!
Ta, Barkface!
Hmm, some things are as unchanging as the forest...<NL>No matter. You had best be on your way.
Now, boy...you must come and see me from time to time, and tell me of your travels.
I look forward to hearing of your progress.
Mm-hmm. Yes, Sir!
Let's be off, shall we?
Time to head back to Ding Dong Dell<NL>and mend a broken heart!
Okay!

evb0150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Looks like he's still the worse for wear, eh?
Mr. Drippy...
We have to help him.
Righto, Ollie-boy.
I'd better explain how it's done then, en't it?
First thing you'll need to do is to take the Locket<NL>Treeface gave you...
...and fill it with the piece of heart ouer friend is missing.
Uh... The piece of heart?
That's right—one of the bits we're all made up of deep down.
The bits we're made up of?
I...I don't understand.
Hmm, how can I put it...?<NL>Ah, just give it a go, you'll soon work it out, mun!
<KEEP>
First off, what that guard's missing is<NL>a drop of good old-fashioned enthusiasm.
Find some and give it to him, and he'll be right as rain!
Okay...
But...where do I find enthusiasm?
Well now, feast youer eyes on that other guard by there.
He's got more get-up-and-go than a sack of squirrels!
If he hasn't got some enthusiasm to spare,<NL>I'm a monkey's uncle!
Ask nicely, and I'm sure he'll give you a lend of it.
Sure, I'll try my best.

evb0160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tidy! Looks like you've got youerself<NL>a locketful of enthusiasm!
Now you've just got to give it<NL>to ouer friend over by there.
Okay, here goes!

evb0170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Beautiful! It worked!
Neato!
Tidy! Looks like he's back in the land of the living!
What's happening? Where am I?
<KEEP>
Well, well, well!
You're back with us, I see!
Yes.
I feel so...strange... As if a weight has been<NL>lifted from my heart... I feel...better!
Thank goodness for that.
I was worried about you.
I'm sorry. I wasn't myself.
But I'm back now, and ready to work harder than ever!
Well, then...
These fine people have all come to<NL>visit our great kingdom.
I think we had better let them in!
Indeed we had!
This way, everybody!
I can't thank you enough! But I'm sure you'll receive your fair share of merit stamps for performing such a heroic feat!
"Merit stamps"? What are those?
You mean you helped me without even thinking of the merit stamps you'd earn? You do have a <color:#1>merit stamp card</color>, don't you?
They're used to collect stamps awarded for<NL>helping those in need.
If you don't have one, you should visit Swift Solutions in town and pick one up.
Listen to me rabbiting on! I have to get this gate open! That's what you're waiting for, isn't it?
Yes please, Sir!
Tidy! We can finally go inside!

evb0175_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
We're finally here!<NL>We're finally in Ding Dong Dell!
Indeed we are, Ollie-boy! There were a few unseen snags on the way, I'll admit...
But all's well that ends well! And I was going to take you to see old Treeface eventually, anyway...
Righto! On with the wand hunt! The king of this place knows a spell or two. Let's see if he can help us, shall we?
A real-life king? Sure! I guess that means we should head for that big old palace over there, huh?

evb0180_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Turned out nice again!
Didn’t it just?
Jeepers...
It's so...different.
Stop staring, mun, it's rude!
But look at those goofy clothes!
Goofy? Are you blind?
Youer the goofy one round these parts!
Huh?
Errgh, look at his funny clothes!
Ha ha! Funny clothes!
Do I really look so strange?
Where in the world is he from?<NL>I've never seen anything like it!
Crikey!
We'd better get you a new outfit<NL>before they put you in the zoo!
Come on, Ollie-boy!
O-Okay...

evb0185_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I'm sorry, Ollie-boy, but no matter how trendy they are over in Motorville, youer clothes are just plain out of place over by here.
Are they really so strange?<NL>But this is all I have!
Then we'll just have to buy you some more, won't we?
There's loads of shops here in Ding Dong Dell, mun!<NL>One of them must sell clothes, en't it?
I guess...<NL>Okay, let's go find <color:#1>a store where I can buy a new outfit</color>!

evb0190_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Excuse me, Ma'am...
Do you sell clothes from this worl—<NL>Uh, I mean, do you sell...regular clothes?
Clothes, dear? Oh, hoot! I'm afraid we don't have any in stock at the moment...
Don't tell us that, mun! Have you seen how the boy's dressed? He's a flipping embarrassment!
He's getting funny looks wherever we go!<NL>My street cred is in ruins!
Hoo! A fairy!
I used to see your kind all the time, but I'll bet children these days don't even know hoo you are.
Youer telling me! Kids these days, mun!<NL>Disrespectful, ignorant, downright rude...
They wouldn't know a fairy if it kicked them in the flipping shins! Not like you, eh, Missus?<NL>Now, about these clothes...
Yes, dear... Hoo, let me think now...
Ah! Now I come to think of it, there was a traveler hoo left a set of clothes here once upon a time...
He'd bought a new outfit, you see, so he<NL>left his old one behind.
Roughly human-shaped, is it? And cheap, I shouldn't doubt. Tidy! We'll take it!
But, Mr. Drippy—
Yes, yes, now I remember! He was the one hoo...
Yes, he said they were very special clothes.<NL>Made from fabric woven from the fibers of the Sky Tree,<NL>if I remember rightly.
Lovely and comfy, extremely hard-wearing,<NL>and lucky to hoot!
I think the only problem would be the size...
If it's you hoo are going to wear this outfit, dear, I'll need a few hours to make some alterations.
It would look hooge on you, otherwise...<NL>Could you come back tomorrow morning?
'Course we can, mun! How's about that then, Ollie-boy! There's lucky!
Neato! Thank you very much, Ma'am!
Hoo hoo hoo! A pleasure, my dear!<NL>Toodle-hoo for now! Until tomorrow!

evb0191_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tomorrow's flipping ages away, mun.
I'd like to go and see the King right away, like, but we can't go till we've got youer outfit sorted, en't it?
I guess not...<NL>But what will we do until tomorrow?
I know! That guard on the gate said something about us getting some kind of card from a place in town, en't it?
Something Solutions, I think he said the name of the shop was... The one we just went in—the Hootique—that's the owl one...
Was it, uh...Swift Solutions?
There's clever of you! That's the one! I knew it was some other kind of bird! Nice one, Ollie-boy!
The stores here sure do have goofy names.
You reckon? They're just named after what they look like, en't it? Anyway, let's get over to <color:#1>Swift Solutions</color>, shall we?

evb0195_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oliver... Oliver...
<KEEP>
Huh?
Mom?
Mom!
You've done so well to make it this far, Oliver.
Mom... Is this...a dream?
You must listen to me now, Oliver. You have to go to him... To face him...
And when you do...you'll learn the truth.
Promise me, no matter how hard it is...
"Him"? Mom, who's "him"?<NL>Mom, what do you mean?
He's someone very...important to both of us.
But who is he?

Morning, young man! And what a purrfectly fine morning it is, too! You slept well, I hope?
Excellent! You'll be on your way now, I expect. Well, if you happen across another Cat's Cradle on your travels, be sure to stay with us again!
Ta, Missus! See you soon!<NL>Righto, Ollie-boy! Back to that owl shop, en't it?
O-Okay!
Mom...

evb0210_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hoo hoo! There you are, dearie!<NL>You'll be happy to hear your clothes are ready!
Tidy! Best try them on then, eh, Ollie-boy?
Sure!
I'll just pop and get them for you, dear.<NL>Wait there, I shan't be a moment!
Yes, Ma'am! Thank you very much!

evb0215_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
What do you think?
Huh? Ohh...there's trendy!<NL>You look proper sharp, Ollie-boy!
<KEEP>
Isn't it a little...goofy?<NL>I mean...a cape?
Don't be silly, dear!<NL>It hoots you down to the ground!
Th-Thank you very much, Ma'am!<NL>How much do we owe you?
Hoo! For those old things? Don't be silly, dear. You'd be doing me a hooge favor just taking them off my hands!
Really?<NL>You're sure?
Hoo hoo hoo! I can't remember the last time I did any sewing. It was an absolute hoot, dear! Think nothing of it!
All I ask is that you pop back and buy a little something from time to time. You'll do that for me, won't you, dear?
'Course we will! Thanks, Missus! There's lucky, Ollie-boy! Looks like we owe this place another visit or three!
We sure do!
And now you've got some dapper duds, we can head up to the palace. Tidy!
Time to go meet the King, huh?<NL>I'm kinda nervous...

evb0235_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ah!
Knickers! He got away!
S-Sorry...
He's a lively one all right! I think he went off towards the palace, Ollie-boy! After him!

evb0240_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So this is the King's favorite fish, huh?
Tidy! That's a <color:#1>red herring</color> if ever I saw one!
Now we can get ouerselves an audience with the King! Let's head back and see that palace guard, shall we?

evb0250_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You again? I'm afraid we still haven't located<NL>King Tom's pet.
This one, you mean?
We came to deliver the King's fish back to him, Sir!
Is that...? Goodness! I'd know the regal scarlet tones of the King's beloved red herring anywhere! Well I'll be!
I reckon he must've swum out through the sewers into town, like.
Is that so? I must let the other guards know right away!
Ah, if I remember rightly, you were...
That's right. We need to see the King.
Yes, of course. But with him in his current state...
What's that? Something up, is there?
You could say that. Did I mention that the person charged with caring for the King's red herring just let it escape?
Everyone in the palace has grown terribly lax of late.<NL>So lax that we need to enlist the help of passing travelers,<NL>as you know only too well.
I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but the King himself has been indolence personified, and it seems to be rubbing off on his subjects.
Indolence...?<NL>Is that like...laziness?
I'm afraid so. Well, perhaps being reunited with his beloved <color:#1>red herring</color> will give him the boost he needs....
In you go!
Tidy! We're off to see the King!<NL>Come on, Ollie-boy!

evb0260_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
(Mmmyawwwn...)
A pleasure to meet you, Youer Meowjesty.
So it was you who delivered one's treasure<NL>back to one, mmm?
<KEEP>
That's right.
Y-Yes, Your Meowjesty.
And?
You wish for a purrize, mmm?
「…」
Go on, mun!
Ask him!
Come now, don't be shy...
Well, Your Meowjesty...
Out with it! Now!
We need your wand!
Mmm? One's wand, hm?
Huh!? What did you say!?
Crikey!
Eek!
That smell...could it be?
Oh!
That's right, Youer Meowjesty. He's not from ouer world.
He's the one whose power freed me from my prison.
What!?
You mean he broke his spell?
This little boy?
...Yes.
Do you understand what you are saying, fairy?
Once you defy him, there is no turning back.
Why did you have to mention that!?
I know, I know, I know, but—
But what, purrecisely?
Well, you know, he might be able to—
「！…」
It's not one's concern.
You may not have the wand.<NL>Now, begone.
Does that mean no wand, Mr. Drippy?
Looks like it.
ふーん…

evb0270_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So how do we get the wand now?
Something wasn't quite right about ouer royal friend. Brokenhearted he is, or I'm brokenheaded.
The King is—?
Lacking <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, it looked like.
And because he's brokenhearted, the whole<NL>kingdom's being dragged down with him...
What are we waiting for?<NL>Let's go find the piece of heart he's missing!
Blimey, you don't need much encouragement, do you?
The guard outside of town was short on<NL><color:#1>enthusiasm</color> too, huh?
Indeed he was, Ollie-boy! Like I say, I reckon the King's brokenheartedness is dragging everyone else down<NL>with him.
But the other guard gave us some of his <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> to help his friend. We should go ask him for some more!
Nonononono, mun! Don't go doing that! There's a very important rule about borrowing pieces of people's hearts.
There is? What is it?
Well, you can't go taking the same piece of heart from the same person twice, see? One little scoop off the top is all it's safe to borrow.
Gee, I didn't know that...<NL>I'll be sure to be real careful from now on.<NL>So what do we do, Mr. Drippy?
We trawl the town for someone else with get-up-and-go aplenty, en't it! It's a sleepy old place, but there's bound to be someone somewhere!
The only problem is, where? Ding Dong Dell's not<NL>exactly village-sized, after all. You might even say<NL>it's proper massive.
I guess it kinda is, huh...
In something of a quandary, are we?
Flipping heck, mun! Don't scare me like that!
Hi, Mr. Telling Stone!
You seemed perplexed, my young friends. I thought you might benefit from a dose of my expansive knowledge!
Thanks! That's real nice of you!
You see, we need to borrow a piece of somebody's heart, but we don't know how to find one...
Hm! Elementary, my dear Oliver! In times like these,<NL>just <color:#1>look to your Locket</color>!
Umm...how do you mean?
Well, not only can it carry pieces of heart, the <color:#1>Locket</color> is also extremely sensitive to their proximity. It will glow when they are nearby.
Tidy! So we can use it to track down some <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> then, en't it?
Incidentally, those with pieces of heart to spare will also glow a verdant green on the mini map in the top right of your screen.
Neato!
It will not serve to tell you which of the virtues the subject has in excess, but it should still prove exceedingly useful to you, nonetheless.
I just know it will!
Now, sally forth and seek ye your piece of heart,<NL>young adventurer!
Thank you so much, Mr. Telling Stone, Sir!
And if ever you find yourselves in need of knowledge again, you may consider me wholly at your service! Farewell for now, friends!
Righto, Ollie-boy! Let's have a look round for someone with a drop of <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> to spare then, shall we?
If youer <color:#1>Locket glows up</color> all of a sudden, we know we're on the right track!
Got it! Let's go, Mr. Drippy!

evb0283_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look, Mr. Drippy!<NL>The Locket—it's glowing!
Tidy! Then there's someone round by here with a piece of heart to spare, en't it?
And the only person round by here is...him! And look at him, mun! He can barely stand still, he's so eager! Jackpot!
You mean you think he has some <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> to spare?
That I do, my lad! I'd bet my lantern on it!<NL>Let's go and get it, shall we?

evb0290_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So, do you think it worked?
Let's see, shall we?
Hmm? What the devil was one up to?
<KEEP>
Your Meowjesty!<NL>Please, tell us you are back to your old self!
Myuh?
Why, one is ten times more energetic than one has ever been!
But one feels...different, somehow...
This is your doing, is it not?
Then you must be rewarded!
Your Meowjesty, it seems that these brave adventurers have lifted the curse that was placed upon you.
Mmm? What!?<NL>Is this true?
Yes, Your Meowjesty.
It appears that you were cursed with<NL>a lack of enthusiasm.
Mmmeow, is that so? One certainly didn't feel oneself for a while there. It seems one is in your debt.
What would you claim as your purrize, hm?
Tidy! You know what to ask for, en't it, Ollie-boy?
Oh, uh, sure! We'd uhh...<NL>We need a magic wand, Your Meowjesty.
Mmmyohhh, is that so? Strangely, one feels as if one has had this conversation before...
Now one thinks of it, there is a wand one purrized very highly as a kitten hidden away safely in one's bedchamber.
There is, eh?<NL>And...?
And one would be willing to part with it. But one will have to find it first. Return later on, and one shall purresent it to you.
Jeepers! Thank you very much, Your Meowjesty!
So, boy... If you are in search of a wand, can one take it that you are purrhaps, a...wizard?
Indeed he is, Youer Meowjesty! A shiny new apprentice wizard! ...Who doesn't exactly know much magic, yet... Ahem.
Hmmm, is that so? Then let one purrovide you with a spell or two. One's wand will be of little use without spells to cast, after all...
Really, Your Meowjesty? That's so kind of you!<NL>Thank you very much!
Mmmyoh-ho-ho! You must enjoy the spells that inspired one so much in one's younger days!
One that unlocks things, and one that restores things to their former glory, eh? What did you used to get up to with these, Youer Meowjesty?
Hmmmyuh? None of your business, fairy!<NL>Now, boy—you travel with a familiar, do you not?
One has sent word to the <color:#1>Cawtermaster's Store</color> down<NL>in the town that you are to be given purrmission<NL>to shop there.
The Cawtermaster's Store?<NL>What kind of a place is that, Youer Meowjesty?
Mmmyou are sure that you are an adventurer?<NL>One cannot help but fear for the safety of<NL>such an innocent...
No matter. The Cawtermaster's Store purrovides<NL><color:#1>weapons and equipment</color> for the use of familiars.
Why not go and browse the purroducts on offer while one seeks out one's wand, hm?
We sure will, Your Meowjesty!<NL>Thank you very much!
Now, one has plenty to attend to—come and purresent yourselves to one again in a short while.

evb0310_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Where are we going, Mr. Drippy? And what's this about somewhere I know real well?
Where d'you think, clever clogs?<NL>Motorville, en't it?
Motorville? But what does Motorville have to do with finding the King?
Well, the answer en't always going to be over by here, Ollie-boy.
Huh? What does that mean?
You got to remember the whole soul mate thing,<NL>en't it? What we see here in this world en't always<NL>the whole picture.
Soul mates... Okay...
Think about it, Ollie-boy. Why are you here in ouer world, eh?
Uh...to save my mom.
Exactly! And youer mam is the Great Sage Alicia's<NL>soul mate, right?
And we're trying to free Alicia from the Soulsnare over by here so we can help youer mam back over by there, en't it?
Well, that's what you told me, Mr. Drippy...
And I wasn't fibbing! So, people in youer world and my world are connected. Not just Alicia and youer mam—<NL>all people.
They are? So...
Exactly! There's clever of you! There's someone over in youer world who's connected to King Tom over by here!
And when someone in ouer world is in a potch, you can sometimes find out how to help them from their soul mate over in youer world.
Because they're connected, see? Obvious when you think about it, en't it?
So somebody in my world is King Tom's soul mate, huh...
That's right. But maybe not a person. And maybe not in such a lofty position as ouer friend the cat king.
Huh?
Well, shopkeeper's cat and King of Ding Dong Dell en't exactly similar status-wise, is it?
Shopkeeper's cat? I don't think I, uh...
Flipping heck, mun! It's like pulling teeth! Okay, so<NL>soul mates can look and even act the same, right?<NL>We've covered that already.
So, when you first saw King Tom, you instantly thought to youerself: "Hello, hello! He's the spitting image of Timmy the cat, he is!"
I...did? Uhh, so you mean that King Tom is...?
King Tom and Timmy Toldrum are...?<NL>But...Miss Leila's cat...?
There's clever of you! Better late than never!
B-But... Timmy's just...a cat...
Exactly! Just like ouer pal King Tom!<NL>What's so strange about that?
Crikey, youer not very perceptive for a youngster, are you?
If two people are soul mates, there'll be similarities somewhere. You've just got to keep an open mind and a peeled eye!
Spot the similarities, and you'll find the soul mate!
Gee, I never knew... So, Timmy, huh?
Timmy indeed, my lad! If we can find that fat old furball, we might get a clue as to where King Tom's got himself to!
So magic us up a <color:#8>Gateway</color>, and let's get over to youer world, shall we? You remember how, don't you?
Sure I do! Let's go see how everybody back in<NL><color:#1>Motorville</color> is doing!

evb0320_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oliver...<NL>I'm sorry, Oliver...
It's—you...
We haven't looked in youer house yet, have we, Ollie-boy! I'll run over there and check now! Back in a bit!
Oh, uh...sure, Mr. Drippy!
.........
I'm sorry, Oliver.<NL>I'm sorry you're all alone.
Huh?
Your mummy...
Y-You know about that?
When Mom died, I thought she'd be gone forever.<NL>I thought I would be all alone...
But now...now I can help her!<NL>I just need to finish what I started...
Oh, I wanted to ask you—that wand, the one I found...<NL>Did you leave it for me? Without it, I could have never gone to the other world...
Maybe you don't even know what I'm talking about, but...if it hadn't been for that wand, I... I'd still be<NL>all alone...
...Really?
Really really?
Really really!
Hurray! I hope you can save your mummy, Oliver!
Thanks! But...who are you? How do you know my name?
I'm Pea! I've always known you, Oliver!
Always...?<NL>...So your name is Pea, huh?
Yes! I'm Pea!
Oh, hey Pea—have you seen a big old cat? His name is Timmy Toldrum. He has stripes all over, and he's<NL>kinda fat...
Mr. Kitty? I know Mr. Kitty!
Mr. Kitty...?
I'll take you to Mr. Kitty, Oliver!<NL>Follow me!
She must mean Timmy, right...?
Oi, Ollie-boy! No sign of old fatty the mog in the house, I'm afraid. What are you doing standing around by here on youer own, anyway?
I might just know where to find Timmy, Mr. Drippy!
You what? How? Where? Hm?
Please, Pea. Could you show us?
Eh? What's all this, then?<NL>Are you all right, Ollie-boy?

evb0330_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Is this where Timmy is, Pea?
Shh!
Huh?
Listen! What's that?
Squeak! Squeak!
A m-mouse!
Eh? Is there something through there, is there?
Timmy!?
Oi, Timmy-boy!<NL>Pull youerself together, mun!
Looks like we'd better take him back to Leila, en't it,<NL>Ollie-boy?
You're right!<NL>Thank you so much for showing us, Pea!
...Huh? But she was...<NL>Where did she go?
What are you standing around for, lazybones!<NL>Get a flipping move on!

evb0340_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oh, thank you, dearie! You brought him all the way back home to Mommy! Wasn't he heavy?
Uh, no. Not really...<NL>Is he okay?
Oh, don't worry about Timmy, Oliver.<NL>It's nothing serious.
He's just a little tired, aren't you, Timmy dear?<NL>It doesn't take much to tire out a big old boy<NL>like you, does it, snookums?
Is that all?<NL>I was worried flipping sick about him!
But what was Timmy doing all the way down at<NL>the garage?
Well, dearie, one of my customers told me all about it.
She said that Rusty's garage is just crawling with mice.
And my dear old Timmy Toldrum just loves to chase the little devils!
Timmy loves to chase mice? But he's so f—
Thank you so much, Oliver, dear! Now I know that's where he disappeared to, I can stop worrying about him.
He was just getting a little exercise—weren't you, my Timmy Toldrum! I guess I could learn a thing or two from you, huh?
Too flipping right you could...
Uh... Okay, Miss Leila. I have to go now.<NL>It was nice seeing you!
And you, dearie. Just let me know if there's ever anything you need now, won't you?
Tidy! You've worked it out too I expect, en't it, Ollie-boy?
Uh...I don't think so, Mr. Drippy.
Come on, mun! Timmy disappeared because he ran off chasing a mouse, didn't he?
So the mouse is the clue, en't it?
It is? King Tom's disappearance has to do with mice, too?
Got it in one! Exactly what it has to do with mice is a whole 'nother question, though...
But I'm sure I've heard someone saying something about mice over in ouer world...
Then we should go back to Ding Dong Dell and investigate! I just know we'll find something!
Righto! Ding Dong Dell it is!

evb0350_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look at that! A flipping familiar! Well I never!
He followed me home when I went to play in the woods. And he's really strong! If he's with me, I'll be fine!
You don't quite get it, do you, sunshine?
Fighting with familiars is flipping hard!
Youer average person can't just jump into the fray and start ordering them around. You need to be a wizard, like Ollie-boy here.
...Okay, then! Oliver, you can have my familiar!
Gee, thanks, Tommy!<NL>Thank you very much!
We'd better head down there, huh?
Indeed we had, Ollie-boy!<NL>Leave it to us, Tommy, my lad!
Okay!<NL>Be careful, Oliver!

evb0360_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tidy! It's open!
Now we can go find the King!
That we can!<NL>In we go, Ollie-boy!
Oh, you can use that spell to open locked chests as well, by the way.
If you find any blue chests lying around, you can cast <color:#8>Spring Lock</color>, and plunder away to youer heart's content!
Blue chests open with <color:#8>Spring Lock</color>... Got it!<NL>Thanks, Mr. Drippy!

evb0370_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Crikey, it's damp as anything down by here!<NL>My lantern'll go all moldy if I don't watch out!
It would really get moldy...?
...Uh-oh! Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of a bucketload of proper feisty beasties! Careful, Ollie-boy!
You'll have to watch youerself from here on in, mun. Things could get ugly...
Okay, Mr. Drippy. I will...
Knickers! Here comes the welcoming committee!
Get ready to rumble!

Grrrowrrr... Mmmyah! Grr!
Your Meowjesty!
Mmmyuh?
Need a hand?
It's you two!<NL>Look—one has retrieved one's wand!

Huh!?
So he wasn't kidnapped?
Say cheese!
The crook...struck one...<NL>Ohhh!
That'll teach you to turn your back on me,<NL>you old tomfool, you!
That is one huge rodent!
You squeaklings work for the fat cat, do you?
Uh, no, we, we, uh...
Too slow!
Ahhhhhh!

evb0390_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You dirty rats!<NL>I'll get you next time!
Knickers! He got away! And he got another stupid catchphrase in before he left and all!
Never mind that, Mr. Drippy.<NL>What about King Tom?
Youer right, mun!<NL>We'd better see how he's doing!
Your Meowjesty! Are you okay?
Oh...it's...you...
Come on, Kingface!<NL>Pull youerself together!
One's wand... One retrieved it from the villain who...purrloined it... Mmmyugh...

The Zodiarchs are assembled, Your Radiance.
<KEEP>
I thank you all for attending.<NL>Very well. I hereby call the Council to order.
You are all doubtless aware of<NL>the purpose of this session.
We are here to discuss the elimination<NL>of the Pure-Hearted One.
Come before us, Dark Djinn!
You summoned me, White Witch?
The so-called "savior" from the other world...
...he must be destroyed.
Shadar, it is time that you proved yourself worthy of<NL>the title of..."Executor."
On one condition...
Huh! The insolence!
He presumes to bargain with our queen?
...Go on.
Very well.
I must request that you entrust this task to me...<NL>and me alone.
Hear me, members of the Council:<NL>I have no need of your aid.
He thinks himself our equal?
What gives him the right?
Hmph. Let him do as he pleases...
He is either very brave or very foolish...
Hm hm... Well, well, well...
To presume to give us orders!
Huh! He no longer needs our aid, hm?
How dare he...?
He grossly overestimates his powers.
Babbling fools...
.........
What is the meaning of this?
Impertinent swine!
Silence!
You will have your wish, Shadar.
I entrust the task entirely to you.
Teach those who speak of a savior...
...the futility of their hope!
It shall be done...
This Oliver... This "savior"...
I will taint his heart with the blackness...
...of despair...

evb0410_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
If one thanks you once, one thanks you a thousand times!
You saved one's life back there!
Looks like youer feeling a bit better now, eh,<NL>Youer Meowjesty?
But you weren't kidnapped, after all. There's funny...my reasoning was a bit off... You don't think I'm losing my touch, do you, Ollie-boy?
I'm just glad the King is safe! That's the most important thing, isn't it, Your Meowjesty?
Mmmyoh, never mind all that! One is just purrfectly livid that that villain Hickory Dock got the better of one!
And all because the loss of one's enthusiasm led one to be caught catnapping!
To think he managed to purrloin one's greatest treasure! Mmmyoh, it is unforgivable!
But one's wand is back in one's possession now. That is the main thing. Now one can finally bestow it upon you.
Thank you, Your Meowjesty!
Bring forth one's wand!
This is one's magic wand.
When one was a kitten, one ran<NL>quite wild with the old thing.
Here. It is yours now.
Thank you very much, Your Meowjesty.
If you-know-who finds out about this,<NL>one fears we shall both live to regret it.
But one could hardly say no to one so very pure...
<KEEP>
When you say "you-know-who..."<NL>you mean Shadar, don't you?
Mmmeowch!? Mmmeohhh!
There's no need to say it out loud, is there?
...But yes, that is who one means.
Youer Meowjesty...
You've gone and given him the wand now.<NL>There's no going back.
...One supposes so.
Don't worry, Your Meowjesty!<NL>I'll bring down Shadar, you'll see!
Now, for coming to one's aid in one's hour of need, let one also purresent you with some new magic. One hopes it will purrove useful.
Golly! Thanks again, Your Meowjesty! I can't wait to try it out! I'm going to become the best wizard ever!
Mmmyoh, really? Very eager, aren't we?
In that case, there is a forest south of one's kingdom known as Golden Grove. And beyond it lies a vast desert.
In the midst of that desert is the city of <color:#1>Al Mamoon</color>.<NL>You must travel there next.
Its ruler is somewhat... But never mind that. Rashaad, one of the four Great Sages, once dwelled there. And still does, one purresumes.
The Great Sages? You mean the proper mighty wizards Alicia used to be one of?
Alicia...
If you wish to expand your magical knowledge, one is sure the aid of the Sages will purrove invaluable.
Really? Thank you, Your Meowjesty!
Righto! It's off across the desert to find us a Great Sage then, is it? Tidy!
<color:#1>Al Mamoon</color>, here we come!

evc0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Here we are—Golden Grove! A quick stroll through here, and we'll be out the other side and into the desert in no time. Tidy!
Jeepers creepers, just look at those giant mushrooms!<NL>It's so different from the Deep Dark Wood...
Youer not wrong, Ollie-boy—it's another type of woodland altogether, this is! No offense to old Treeface, but the soil by here is just...better.
Proper fertile, it is. The trees are weighed down with fruit and nuts all the year round. That's why they call it the Forest of Plenty, see?
The Forest of Plenty, huh...
Ahh, it's been a while since I dropped by.<NL>There's nostalgic! Full of fairies, this old place is.<NL>Shall I give the boys a shout?
Yes please, Mr. Drippy!
Ooooooooi! How do, booooooys?<NL>Anyone about? It's me—Drippy!
...Nobody's home.
What!? No welcoming committee for the Lord High Lord of the Fairies? Something proper weird is going on, mun...
No fairies in town, and none in the forest neither.<NL>What's happened to them all?
Maybe we should go deeper into the forest.<NL>We might be able to find out more there...
Well, since we're going that way anyway... Let's just push on through to Al Mamoon and see what we can see,<NL>shall we?
Okay! Boy, I sure hope we get to meet some of your fairy friends, Mr. Drippy!

evc0015_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
These giant mushrooms are blocking the way, Mr. Drippy. What should we do?
What do you mean? Jump on the flipping things,<NL>of course!
Huh!? But won't they break?
Nah, mun! It'd take more than a slip of a lad like you landing on them to finish off these formidable fungi! You'll be fine!
I sure hope so...<NL>I guess we don't have much choice, huh?

evc0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Jeepers...<NL>What is that?
Tidy! It's a familiar egg!
A familiar...egg? But didn't you tell me that familiars come from people's hearts?
That they do, my lad! But not only from there!
Familiars can be born wherever there's plenty of what you might call "life force," see?
The sky, the sea, the forest, the field... It doesn't matter where it is, Ollie-boy—when enough life force builds up, out they pop!
In fact, they can even be born from everyday objects if they're used long enough and loved hard enough! I know—mad, en't it?
Wow! Life force sure sounds powerful... So this egg is made from life force building up here in the forest, huh?
There's quick, you are! Life force is a mysterious and potent energy, filled with wonder!
But the results en't always so magical. Sometimes, instead of friendly familiars, wild and vicious beasties are<NL>born instead!
You mean the creatures that are always attacking us?
The very same! And the only way to teach them not to go round attacking people is to fight back, en't it?
Don't look so worried, mun! We don't kill the pooer things, we just...send them somewhere where they can't bother us for a while.
...Okay.
I wonder what kind of creature will come out of this egg...
I can't wait to see it hatch!
Well, you'll be waiting a while, Ollie-boy.
Look at the bits of tree round the edge of it—all withered, they are. Seems like the forest's life force has taken a turn for the sparse...
That must be why the fairies have all cleared out too, eh? Sorry, but if things stay as they are, this egg en't hatching anytime soon.
Gee, that's so sad... There must be something we can do, Mr. Drippy!
There is indeed, Ollie-boy! And it's right there in youer hand! Do I have to spell it out?
All you have to do is cast a spell that can unwither the withered bits. Restore them to their former glory, if you know what I mean.
Sure, Mr. Drippy! Let me see... <color:#1>A spell that can restore the withered branches to how they used to be...</color>

evc0021_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tidy! Look, Ollie-boy! It's hatching!<NL>Witness the miracle of new life!
Jeepers creepers...<NL>Sh-Should we help or something?
クル～！！
Neato! It hatched!<NL>We did it, Mr. Drippy!
Ahh, there's beautiful! There's nothing like a good hatching to get me welling up...
Hee hee! Stop it! It tickles!
I think he likes you!
Ha ha! He's cute!
クルルゥー！
Okay, little one. We have to go now.<NL>Enjoy your life here in the forest, won't you?
Eh? You en't taking him with you, Ollie-boy?
He only just hatched, Mr. Drippy! I can't let him come with us—it's too dangerous.
Yeah, you've got a point, I suppose. Fair enough.<NL>Righto, littlie! Look after youerself, eh?<NL>Bye for now!
Good-bye, now! And take care!
クル～…？

evc0025_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
クルルル～！！
Well, look who it is! It's the littlie from before!<NL>How do, young 'un?
Did he follow us?
クルルッ！！
Looks like he wants us to follow him, now!
Is there something he wants to show us?
I wonder. Maybe he's found some of my fairy butties, eh?
Speaking of fairies, he looks a lot more like I imagined a fairy would look than you do, Mr. Drippy...
Oh, he does, does he? Well that just shows what you know, doesn't it? Hmph! The cheek!

evc0027_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
クルッ！！
Thanks for showing us the way!
クルッ！！<NL>クルルー！！
What's that...? He's saying he reckons he could be useful to you, Ollie-boy. Wants to tag along on ouer journey,<NL>he does.
B-But...he's just a kid! It's too dangerous!
クルクルルッ！！
Ha! Cheeky little so-and-so! "Look who's talking," he says!<NL>He means youer just a kid youerself, en't it?<NL>And he's got a point...
H-He really said that...?<NL>But...
Don't fret, Ollie-boy! Creatures like him are born to be familiars—and traveling round with wizards like youerself is what familiars do, en't it?
Gee, I guess...<NL>Okay! You can come with us!
クルルルゥ～！！
You'd better give the little fellow a name, then.<NL>That'll seal the deal. Make you officially his master, like.
Sure! Thanks!

evc0030_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look, Mr. Drippy!<NL>It's a fountain!
But it's all dried up...
Dearie, dearie me... This en't too pretty, is it?<NL>But now we know what the problem is, at least.
We do...?
Well, this is the Spring of Life, en't it?<NL>It's what put the "Plenty" in "Forest of Plenty"!
The reason the fairies have scarpered and the tree that familiar egg was in was all withered is because the spring by here has run dry.
Of all the low moves... Who would do something like this? Proper despicable, it i— Uh-oh!
What's wrong, Mr. Drippy?
I've got a feeling in my lantern that the culprit is<NL>about to appear...
He is?
Trust me, mun, it's how these things always happen...
ROAR!
See?
Wh—? Ohhh! Jeepers...

evc0035_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Thank goodness! That horrible creature has gone...
That wasn't just any old creature, Ollie-boy.<NL>That was the guardian of this here forest.
"Guardian"? You mean like the Guardian of the Woods?
That I do. It's like I said, en't it? Life force can make things pop up all over the place.
And in places like this forest, the desire of the inhabitants to protect their home gives birth to massive guardian beasties, see?
Beasties like that one you fought over in the Deep Dark Wood, and the lad we just met. I dunno if you noticed, but his eyes were proper funny...
Do you think...?<NL>Shadar?
I wouldn't be surprised if he'd had a hand in this sordid little affair. Drying up a spring is just the kind of low-down trick he'd play.
Knickers. Well, the guardian is back to his old self, but what are we going to do about the Spring of Life, hm?
I've been thinking about that, Mr. Drippy...
We healed the tree the egg was in with a spell, didn't we? Could we maybe use the same spell to restore the Spring of Life?
There's clever of you, Ollie-boy! Reckon some of my brains must be rubbing off on you! Give it a try, my lad!
All right, Mr. Drippy!<NL>I sure hope it works!

evc0037_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So this is the real Spring of Life...<NL>It's so...pretty!
It is indeed! And now the guardian and the Spring are back to their normal selves, the fairies won't be far behind! Tidy!
Neato! I sure hope we can meet some fairies the next time we're here!
Me too, Ollie-boy, me too.<NL>Right! To Al Mamoon!
Yes, Sir!

evc0040_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Here we are! Al Mamoon! Beautiful!
Mm hm.
It's different from Ding Dong Dell, huh.
Well of course it flipping is!
It's slap-bang in the middle of the desert for a start!
Mmm!<NL>What's that delicious smell?
That's the babanas, en't it.
Babanas are what Al Mamoon's famous for, see?
You’ve never eaten a fruit like it.<NL>Gorgeous, they are.
...Tell you what—I'm starving! Fancy a babana split?
<KEEP>
Really?
They're that good, huh? Wow!
Too flipping right they are! This place was built on the babana trade—there's tasty for you!
Okay, let's try some!
Before we go babanas though, we should try and find this Rashaad, en't it? It's what we came here for, after all.
You're right. We should ask around and find out if anybody knows him.
Uhh, excuse me, Sir...do you know where I can find the Great Sage Rashaad?
"The Great Sage Rashaad"?
It is a long time since he was called by that name.
These days, you would do better to ask after "Rashaad, seller of babanas."
He sells babanas?<NL>You mean he's not a sage anymore?
But getting him to teach me about magic was our whole reason for coming here...
Hmm, there's worrying... Still, we were after a babana split anyway, so we might as well stop by and see what's what, en't it?
I guess...<NL>Okay, let's go find Rashaad!

evc0050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Excuse me...
Are you Mr...Rashaad?
Yes. I am.
Mr. Rashaad, Sir...
I need you to teach me magic.
I need you to teach me the most powerful spells there are so I can defeat Shadar!
<KEEP>
Defeat Shadar? You?
Yes, Sir!
...Your journey has been wasted.<NL>I no longer practice the magic arts.
Huh?
But why not?
I thought you were one of the Four Great Sages who knows everything there is to know about magic.
It matters not what I was, I use magic no more.
Is she...?
...What do you want?
...Who are you?
Jeepers...
The pooer thing's brokenhearted, looks like.
...
Shadar stole a piece of her heart...
It was my fault.
I defied him, and to punish me...he did this.
That is why I fight no longer.
I cannot risk my child's life—I will not.
We must accept our fate and live out our days in peace.
You're wrong.
She wouldn't want this.
Hm?
She's not in pain because a piece of her heart was stolen.
It's because...you gave up fighting—because you gave up on everything—that's why she's in pain!
You are sure of this?
Yes, I am.
I see...
I see now that you would say anything to enlist my aid!
Begone!
Leave us in peace!
You're making a mistake!<NL>I wasn't trying to—

evc0060_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Well, he wasn't wrong.
It looks like Shadar's stolen a part of the pooer dab's heart.
But we have to help her!
We have to make her heart whole again!
Nah.
"Looks like," I said. This is different.
Huh?
Her heart's not just broken, it's closed.
"Closed"?
What does that mean?
It's like this, see...
She's not just had a part of her heart stolen, she's closed it up tight, too—to keep the rest safe, like.
<KEEP>
So, before we can think about replacing what's missing,<NL>we'll have to open it back up again, en't it.
And how do we do that?
We go to youer world.
If we find whoever she's connected to by there,<NL>we can work out what's going on with her by here.
So we head over youer way and find her soul mate.
All right!
Let's do it!
Righto! Back to youer world it is!

evc0070_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So, where to start the search, eh?
You remember how this works, en't it, Ollie-boy?<NL>It's all about spotting the similarities.
Somewhere round by here is someone who's similar to young Esther in some way. Now, what girls do you know?
G-Girls!?
Uh, I don't really talk to girls...<NL>I mainly talk to Phil...
Crikey, well that's no good, is it?<NL>How are we going to do this, then?
Uhh, I'm sure there's somebody she reminds me of...
Can't quite put youer finger on it, is it?<NL>Never mind.
If brainwork won't work, legwork will! Let's go for a stroll round town and see if we can spot Esther's soul mate that way, shall we?
Okay, Mr. Drippy!<NL>Let's go find that girl!

evc0073_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hey, I just thought...
What's up, mun? You having a nice time thinking about girls, is it?
Huh!? No! I just...
When I used to come here to Phil's garage, there was a girl... She was always looking at us from her window...
From her window, eh? Sounds like a proper shrinking violet.
I guess so...<NL>That's the window, up there.
Oh!<NL>That's her, Mr. Drippy!
Flipping heck, Ollie-boy! Why didn't you think of her straightaway? She's the spitting image of her, mun!
Huh? Of who?
Who d'you flipping think, you blockhead! The Great Sage's daughter, en't it! The one who's obviously her flipping soul mate!
It's that obvious? I...I never noticed.
You sure have good eyes, Mr. Drippy. She was only in the window for a second.
Never underestimate the razor-sharp eyes of a fairy, my boy! Spot a speck of dust on the head of a pin, I could!
Anyway, it's her, and no mistake! Let's go and barge ouer way into her bedroom!
Uh...okay...

evc0075_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hm?
...It's no good.<NL>There's no answer.
Is something the matter, dear?<NL>There's nobody home, you know.
Uh, I need to speak to the girl who lives here.
You're a friend of Myrtle's? Oh, you poor dear!<NL>You must be awfully worried about her!
Huh?
Oh, my!<NL>You haven't heard?
Well, just between you and I, things haven't been going so well for Myrtle's family lately.
H-How come?
Her father works every hour of every single day! Nothing but work, work, work! He's never at home anymore!
Such a shame... Rusty was always such a devoted father...
But something has happened to him. He's changed.<NL>I hear him shouting at them through the walls...
I don't know how poor Betty copes...<NL>Let alone young Myrtle... Such a shame...
Betty is...
That's right, dear, she's Rusty's wife. And she's every bit as devoted to him as she always was.
Why, only this morning, I heard her promising to bring his lunch to him down at the garage.
All the love she pours into those sandwiches...
It's enough to break your heart!<NL>Why, I'm welling up just thinking about it!
Such a kind soul... Poor, poor, Betty... I have half a mind to tell that Rusty Cartwright just how lucky he is!
Jeepers...
Oh, just listen to me gossiping on and on!<NL>Do ignore me, dear, I'm just a silly old woman!
Say hello to Myrtle for me, won't you?
Crikey, sounds like things are none too rosy in the Cartwright household, eh?
Mr. Drippy... We can't leave her like that.<NL>We have to help her. We have to help Myrtle...
That's easier said than done, Ollie-boy. She's not coming out for a chat, and we're not getting in unless we go magicking the door open...
You're right!<NL>We should use magic to open the door!
I'm the only one who knows how! I'm the only one who can go in there and speak to her!
You sure you want to be doing this, mun?
When Mom died, I...
If you hadn't taken me over to your world when I thought I was all alone...
If you hadn't helped me... I'd still be alone right now...
That's why we have to help Myrtle. If we don't, she'll be left staring out of her window forever. All alone...
That's justification enough for a bit of breaking and entering in my book! Let's get in there!
Okay, Mr. Drippy!

evc0078_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
That was...
Pea!<NL>Hey, maybe...
Eh? What's going on, Ollie-boy?
Maybe Pea knows something...
E-Eh...? What the flipping heck's going on...?

evc0079_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...It's open!
How the flip...!?<NL>Did you do another spell on it or something?
No. It wasn't me. It was Pea.
Huh?<NL>Where'd she—?
Never mind all that! Let's get in there, shall we? There's a damsel in distress up there, mun!

evc0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Who are you?
My name's Oliver. Don't worry, I'm not crazy.<NL>I'm a kid from right here in Motorville.
<KEEP>
Just like you.
I know.
I've seen you.
You have?
I'm sick.<NL>I can't leave this room.
If I go outside...it hurts.
So all I can do is look out at the world from my window.
That's why they call her Starey Mary!
Shh!
Don't worry, mun. No one can hear me by here.<NL>I can talk as loud as I want!
Yes...
That's why they call me Starey Mary.
Huh?
Crikey! Can she hear me?
That's what they call me around here.<NL>But you knew that already, huh?
U-Uh, I...
I bet you think I'm...weird, don't you?
No! I-I don't!
It's okay. I don't mind.
You should go, before my father comes home.
...
Oi, come here a sec.
This is proper weird...
I've looked as hard as I know how, but she doesn't seem sick at all. She's as fit as a fiddle, in fact!
You mean...you can tell?
I'm Lord High Lord of the Fairies, en't I?<NL>'Course I can tell!
So what is wrong with her?
Well, whatever sickness she had might be gone,<NL>but something's still got a hold over the pooer dab.
Hmm...
What is it?
Oh, ummm...nothing.<NL>I'm gonna come see you again, okay Myrtle?
Well, if you can't leave your room, I'll come to you instead. That way, we can be friends.
How does that sound?
Oliver...
You can't...
My father won't allow it.
You should leave.
But Myrtle...

evc0085_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It's just like you said, Mr. Drippy. It's almost like Myrtle and Esther are the same person.
En't it, though? They could be twins, mun!<NL>I knew they were soul mates the moment I laid eyes on her!
But she en't brokenhearted. There's something else stopping her from getting better.
It must be...her parents...<NL>Her family is...
If that old gossip is to be believed, yeah.<NL>Sounds like her folks en't getting on too well.
But are family squabbles really the kind of thing we want to go getting mixed up in, Ollie-boy?
Maybe not, but...we have to help Myrtle.
Family is important.<NL>It's everything...
Well, since you put it like that... Go on then, let's help the pooer dab out! Next stop, <color:#1>Rusty's shop</color>!
Let's go, Mr. Drippy!

evc0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
This must be Rusty's garage, eh, Ollie-boy?<NL>And that must be him over by there.
I guess so, huh..
Uh, excuse me, Sir...are you Myrtle's father?<NL>I came to ask about her...
Can't you see I'm busy? Beat it, kid!
Eh? What's that swirling round him?
...Nah, can't be.
Honey... I brought your lunch.
Not this again...<NL>I'm not hungry.
But, honey...<NL>If you don't eat, you'll get sick!
I said, I'm NOT HUNGRY!
...Okay, honey.<NL>Just look after yourself. Please...
So that was Myrtle's mom, huh?
You, too! Get outta here, before I throw you out!
B-But Sir, we...!
Crikey, look at those eyes!<NL>Broken as heck, his heart is!
He's heartbroken? But...<NL>He's not from your world, Mr. Drippy...
Let's worry about that later. For now, we know what the problem is. We need to mend Rusty's broken heart, en't it?
I guess we do.<NL>Don't worry, Sir—we're going to help you!
Eek!
Youer kidding me! A flipping Nightmare?<NL>Now we're for it...
A Nightmare?<NL>You mean, like...a bad dream?
Nah, mun! Much worse! A Nightmare's an evil spirit that latches onto the brokenhearted! See that black misty stuff? That's how you know.
Knickers! The mist is getting darker. That can mean only one thing...and it en't good news...
Nnngh... Ahhhhhh...

evc0091_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Honey!
Ngh... Betty...<NL>Stay away from me!
His heart is still broken...
'Course it is. We only got rid of the Nightmare, mun! Mending his heart's a whole 'nother problem.
Uh, Mr. Drippy... These Nightmares...<NL>Just what are they?
Well, they're sort of like beasties, only they're born from broken hearts, and they latch onto them and sort of possess them, see?
And Shadar is behind the Nightmares, too?
Look at him, Ollie-boy! Him and Rashaad are like peas from the same pod, en't it?
What Shadar's done is, he's got the better of Rashaad over in ouer world by attacking his soul mate over by here in youer world.
That's just awful...<NL>He's attacking people in my world now?
Looks like it, eh? And if we don't mend his heart, he might get taken over by another Nightmare. We need to sort this out, Ollie-boy!
You saw what he was like before, en't it? It's pretty obvious that what he's missing is a man-sized helping<NL>of <color:#1>kindness</color>!
Kindness... Gee...
That's right. Anyone overflowing with the milk of human kindness spring to mind, Ollie-boy?
A real kind person, huh?
Honey! Oh, honey! Are you okay?<NL>Talk to me! Please!
Well, well, well! Sometimes the thing youer looking for plonks itself down right on youer doorstep! There's lucky!
I guess so...

evc0099_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Nnngh...
Honey!<NL>Oh, honey...
Betty...<NL>What am I doing here?
...Did you do something with your hair?
Oh, Rusty! ...Hm. You're looking very handsome<NL>yourself, honey.
Tidy! It worked!<NL>Ahh, marital bliss, eh? There's lovely!
Excuse me, uh—
Oi, what do you think youer doing?<NL>This is no time to be interrupting!
Let's leave them to it and go and tell Myrtle everything's back to normal with her folks, shall we?
...I guess you're right. Let's go.

evc0100_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
(sigh)
Oliver. What is it?
Well...
Uh...
If my father sees you, he'll...
Myrtle... Come with me!
Huh?
You can go outside now!<NL>You're not sick anymore!
<KEEP>
I-I can't, Oliver.<NL>Just thinking about going out there gives me goose bumps...
Myrtle.
Oh!
Go on out and play, Myrtle.
But...?
Father?
Sweetheart...<NL>I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened to me. I wasn't there when you were sick... When you needed me...
And I was fighting with your mother the whole time. I guess maybe the thing that was keeping you closed up in here...
Maybe it was me.
Father...
You were scared, somewhere deep down,<NL>that if you went away, even for a little while...
...your mother and I would lose the<NL>one thing keeping us together.
That we...we wouldn't be a family anymore.
I'm right, aren't I?
That's why you...why you were...
Something deep inside you wouldn't let you leave the house.
Father, I...
It's all right, sweetheart. Your mother and I...<NL>It's going to be okay.
Father!
Please, Myrtle...
Please forgive me.
Oh, I do! Daddy, I do!
Are those tears, Bunting?
Huh!? No, they're not!
So much for you being honest...
Oliver?
Hm?
I'm going to try. I'm going to go outside.
Will you come with me?
Myrtle...
Ahh...
Myrtle!
I did it! Oliver, I did it!
I'm outside! I'm outside!
Hee hee! Ha ha ha!
Ahh, there's beautiful.
Hm hm.
Hm!
Oliver...<NL>Thank you so much!
I'm so happy for you, Myrtle!
I couldn't have done it without you, Oliver! I'm going to go outside every day from now on! I'll go to school again, and meet new people, and buy new clothes...
It's so strange... I was so scared to come outside, but now I'm here, I feel like I could go anywhere! Like I could do anything!
Listen to her, mun! It's like a different person talking! She's got a heart and a half in her now!
She has! I can feel it, too!
Mr. Drippy... There's someone who could really use some of Myrtle's heart.
Nice thinking, Ollie-boy! I know just who you mean. And I reckon Myrtle here can give us exactly what we need.
Is something the matter, Oliver?
Myrtle... I, uh...I know a girl who's just like you. And she's going through something terrible...
You're so brave. I wanted to know if you'd let me give some of your courage to this girl...to help her. And to help her family...
Of course.<NL>But how do we do that?
We use magic.<NL>And I know just the spell!
Magic?<NL>You're an...interesting boy, Oliver!
But sure, go ahead.
All right. Close your eyes.
Like this?

She does, huh... Mr. Drippy, there's someone in Al Mamoon who could really use some of that <color:#1>courage</color>.
Nice thinking, Ollie-boy! A drop of Myrtle's new-found bravery is just what we need to kick-start young<NL>Esther's recovery!

My heart... It feels...warm...
That means the magic worked. Thank you so much, Myrtle. Now my friend can finally start to get better.
I'm glad...
Righto, Ollie-boy! We've got some courage to deliver, en't it? Let's get going!
Sure.
Myrtle...<NL>I have to go now.
Wish your friend luck from me, won't you, Oliver?<NL>I hope she gets better soon.
Thanks, Myrtle! I will!
See you soon, Oliver!

evc0130_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
What is this?
Where am I?
What happened?
It was Shadar. He stole a piece of your heart.
My heart...?
Is it you, Esther? Is it really you?<NL>Oh, my dear daughter!
<KEEP>
Father...
Oh, forgive me, my child...
(Happy chuckle.)
You were robbed of your courage, but I...
I have only myself to blame for the loss of my own.
Oliver—it is you who taught me this.<NL>You have my thanks.
You're welcome, Mr. Rashaad!
I will join you in the fight against Shadar.
The day will soon come when the Clarion rings out across the land once more.
The Clarion?
Oh, it's an old story from way back, that is.
Back when the world was at peace, like.
The three kings of our world combined their skills and knowledge to create a flute that symbolized the great peace.
The sound of this flute came to represent the unity of the nations of the world.
How long is it now since the call of the Clarion was heard...?
Not since the three kings got into<NL>a right old potch and fell out, I heard...
It's up to us!
The Clarion will ring out again,<NL>and we will be the ones to play it!
Very well, daughter. Let us do our best.<NL>Let us help Oliver in his fight.
Thank you so much, Mr. Rashaad, Sir.
Let me come with you, Oliver!<NL>I want to help you fight Shadar!
I have a familiar to help me, just like you! Here, boy!
Wow! You can fight with familiars too, Esther?
Indeed she can. Esther's talent lies in the training and handling of familiars.
So she's more of a familiar keeper than a wizard, is it?<NL>Fair enough. Useful folks to have around, they are.
This is my drongo. His name is Gogo.<NL>Say hello, Gogo!
Tidy! Now that's settled, let's get down to business.<NL>You remember what young Oliver came here for,<NL>en't it, Rashaad?
Mr. Drippy!
I do. You wish to learn the arts of the sages, do you not?
Y-Yes, Sir!
Then you will need these spells.
Thank you, Mister Rashaad, Sir!
I am satisfied that you do not lack the determination required. You came here from another world to face Shadar, after all.
Y-You knew? About me being from another world, I mean.
Hm?
It was your actions that revealed your origins to me.<NL>You healed Esther when I could not.
Which told me that you must have helped her soul mate in the other world.
And only one who called that world home could have done such a thing.
Wow. So Oliver is from one of the other worlds you told me about, Father?
And he was the one who saved me...
Yes...it's strange... It feels like I've met you<NL>in a dream or something...
Oliver. It seems there are things that only one such as you can do. You may be able to help our world. You shall have my aid.
Thank you, Sir!<NL>I won't let you down! I will beat Shadar!
Perhaps. But you will need much training first. Without complete command of the magical arts, you cannot hope to defeat him.
The Four Great Sages could not overcome the Dark Djinn. For a mere boy to do so will require more than<NL>enthusiasm alone.
What're you thinking? He's going to need to cram a shedload of experience under his belt in a heckuva short time, en't he?
Indeed he is. The kind of experience offered by the Trials of the sages. Oliver, you must undertake them.
Trials? Where do I take these trials?
In the north of the desert.<NL>At the <color:#1>Temple of Trials</color>.
The Temple of Trials? You mean...?
I do. The home of the Supreme Sage, master of familiars. You, too, have much to learn, Esther.
Only those with the Supreme Sage's blessing are permitted to open the doors of the Temple. I will accompany you.
Thank you, Father! You'll be great at the Trials, Oliver,<NL>I know you will!
Thanks, Esther! And thank you, Mister Rashaad, Sir!

evc0150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oliver?
Hm? What is it, Esther?
Why did you set out on this journey in the first place?
<KEEP>
Most people wouldn't dream of taking on<NL>someone like Shadar.
Well, uh... It's my mom...<NL>I have to save her.
Your mother?
Uh, yeah.
She...she died—saving my life...
But Mr. Drippy says there's a way to<NL>help her here in this world.
So, you've come here to save your mother?
Yeah...I guess...
Wow.
Huh?
Doing all this for the sake of someone you love.
I just think that's amazing.<NL>
I wish I had as good a reason<NL>as you for making this journey.
(sigh)
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean I wished that—
...It's okay.
But...
Shadar is incredibly powerful.
He breaks the hearts of anyone who defies him.
...So no one dares to resist.
And they say no one can defeat him...
I know that...<NL>But...I have to—
You have to try, right?
I... Yeah.
It's so strange...
You don't look powerful in the least,<NL>but somehow I just know you can beat him.
I wonder why...
Th-Thanks...
Anyway, enough of that. It's late.
Okay.

evc0160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
The Temple, at last.<NL>The Trials await.
Blimey, it's proper impressive, this place, eh?<NL>Shrouded in an air of potent mystery, it is!
Did you expect less from the sacred haven built to train the mighty sages?
Did you train here, Mr. Rashaad?
Of course. All who bear the name "sage" must<NL>pass the Trials.
So Alicia would have taken the Trials, too...
Oliver...
To become a sage, the candidate must possess purity of heart, breadth of knowledge, and mastery of both spells and familiars.
The Temple both tests and tempers all of these qualities.
And if we can't pass the Trials, there's no way we'll ever be able to beat Shadar, is there?
Precisely. But even the gifts granted you on passing the Trials will not be enough. You will need a far greater power to defeat the Dark Djinn.
Well...I-I guess we'd better just focus on the Trials for now, huh?
You are ready.<NL>It is time to release the seal.
Beyond this door waits the Supreme Sage.<NL>It must be opened by your own hand.
Yes, Sir!

evc0170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Uh, we, uh...
So this is the Supreme Sage, is it?
Ahem... Your Honor, we have come to perform the Trials.
<KEEP>
......Not me.
Huh?
Oh!
Idiots!
I'm the Supreme Sage!
That's just my stupid servant Umbopa!
Hmph!
Wh— Huh!?
Crikey! We got the wrong one!
I can't believe it! The Supreme Sage is just a sweet<NL>little boy!
"Sweet"!? Eurgh!
Oh!<NL>I'm sorry, Your Honor...
I don't care! I am sweet! And clever! And handsome! I'm just so modest, I don't like it when people talk about it!
Um, I see...
How did you lot get in here, anyway? Only people with my permission are allowed to open the front door.
It has been a long time, Your Honor.
Is that you, Rashaad? Blimey! When did you get so old? You're ancient!
But you have not changed at all, I see, Master Solomon.
Did you know my father when he was young? Hee hee! How strange!
Eh? "Father"? You mean you're...
Yes, Your Honor. I present my daughter, Esther.<NL>Please forgive her rudeness.
Heh! I don't care! What I care about is you having a daughter! How did that happen? You were always so shy and...rubbish!
Oh well, congratulations. Anyway, what are you doing here? What do you want?
These children, Master Solomon...Oliver and Esther...<NL>I would ask that you allow them to take the Trials.
Really? If you're recommending them, you must think they're pretty good. That or you've gone bonkers in your old age! Ha ha!
I see great potential in them both.<NL>But they lack power.
Beginners, are you?<NL>And you want to get stronger?
Why? What for?
I...<NL>I need to...
I need to defeat Shadar!
What!? YOU!? Beat Shadar!?
You do realize what you're saying, don't you?
Yes, Your Honor!
And I'm going to help him! Oliver helped me, and now I'm going to pay him back!
.........
Fine. But the Trials are hard. Really hard.<NL>I know, because I made them.
We're ready, Your Honor!
Ha! It looks like you might be! Okay, I'll let you do them.
Thank you, Master Solomon!<NL>We'll pass all the Trials, you'll see!
You have my thanks, Your Honor.<NL>Then I will take my leave.
You're going already? Boring! You should stay here! What's wrong? Scared to see them fail or something?
He's right, mun! After all we've done for you, the least you can do is stick around and see these two through the flipping Trials!
I cannot. I have duties of my own to attend to. I will not remain a babana seller forever. I must prepare to walk the path of the sage once more.
That's not the real reason, is it, Father?<NL>Why are you so desperate to go home?
Don't you see? He wants us to take the Trials without any help! We have to prove we can make it on our own!
...You're right.<NL>Okay, Oliver, let's do our best!
Good luck with your preparations, Father!<NL>Don't sell all the babanas, will you?
Hm hm. Of course not, my child. When you complete the Trials, you shall have all the babanas you could wish for. Good luck.
Come on, all this talking is boring! Let's start the Trials, shall we? Go and ask stupid old Umbopa about what you have to do!

evc0340_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You passed the first two tests. Not bad.
Now we know you're good friends, and you're not completely stupid.
And we also know my powers of encouragement and support can work miracles! Tidy!
Hey! You had nothing to do with it!<NL>Anyway, Oliver, it's time...
The final test...<NL>What is it, Master Solomon?
Ha! Everyone knows that!<NL>It's the Test of Strength, stupid!
This is a test of your combat ability. You've guessed what you have to do, haven't you?
We're going to have to fight somebody, huh?
Ooh, aren't you clever! But not just anyone! Hee hee hee! You're going to get your heads beaten in!
Oh, but I didn't want him smashing the place up, so I've prepared a special place for you to fight in.
Anyway, you probably need a rest first because you're so small and weak. I'll be waiting here when you're ready.
Yes, Your Honor!

evc0345_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So where does the last trial take place, Master Solomon?
In my special secret place!<NL>Watch this!
Door, door, up from the floor!
...Abracadoorbra!
Amazing!<NL>He conjured a door out of thin air!
You have to go through it to get to where we do the Test of Strength. It's a little place called...The Solosseum!
Tidy! You ready for the final test, Ollie-boy?
We have to pass it! We just have to!
I'm ready! Come on, you guys!

evc0350_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
This is the final trial...
This looks a bit flipping serious.
Jeepers!
Oliver!
Look!
Ahh!

evc0390_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Heh! You passed the Test of Strength!
We did it!<NL>Oliver, we did it!
We sure did!
That's the last trial.<NL>You've passed them all.
Oh, I got you a graduation present.<NL>Here.
New spells? Thank you very much, Master Solomon!
Tidy! They look like proper useful ones, too!
Of course they are, stupid! I wouldn't give them rubbish ones, would I?
Anyway, it's time for the main event! My specialist<NL>subject—familiars! I'm going to teach you the<NL>secrets of creature taming!
Creature taming?<NL>Ooh, that sounds interesting!
Heh! You're a bit annoying, but at least you're enthusiastic! Okay, first let's talk about <color:#1>serenading</color>.
What's serenading?
I'm just about to tell you, aren't I, stupid! It's something you can't do without a special instrument, for a start.
An instrument? So that means...
Yep! Leave it to me, Oliver!
I'd better give you it before we carry on.<NL>Umbopa!
......Master.
Here, take this.
It's called the "heart-winning harp."
Hup!
Master...
Wow, it's beautiful!
<KEEP>
It's not just beautiful, it's useful, too.
You can play it to tame creatures and make them<NL>your familiars.
It's probably easier to show you than explain.<NL>You're quite slow, after all.
I've prepared three creatures for you to tame.<NL>Pick one you like the look of.
Yes, Your Honor!
You can tame creatures during battle.<NL>Try it out with these ones.
Don't look so scared! They're my pets—they won't attack you! Hmph... Wimps!
But...how do I tame them?
Well, every now and again, when you beat a creature, it will be so impressed, it will fall in love with you.
If that happens, yucky <color:#1>hearts</color> will appear above its head like this.
Hee hee! Aww, that's sweet!
Eurgh... Anyway, when you see the hearts, it's time for you to play a <color:#1>serenade</color>.
If you manage not to mess it up, the creature becomes tame, and joins you as one of your familiars.
That seems simple enough.
It doesn't matter who beats a creature, it can still go all gooey and girly and lovey-dovey. But only you can tame it, Esther.
So if we want a creature to join us,<NL>Esther has to play the song?
I just said that, didn't I? Stop asking stupid questions and give it a try!
Yes, Your Honor!<NL>...But which one shall we pick?
Why do we have to flipping pick? Can't he give us the whole lot of them, the stingy old so-and-so?
What's the matter? Spoiled for choice?
Well, when you've finished moaning and groaning, just let me know which one you want me to give you completely for free.

evc0410_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
We did it!<NL>We tamed a creature!
Heh! Not bad for a first try, I suppose.
Like I said, anyone can beat a creature, but Esther has to play the song to tame it.
So you'll have to work together if you want to get more familiars. I know it's hard for selfish brats like you, but you'll just have to try.
Yes, Master Solomon!<NL>We understand!
Neato, huh, Esther?
Oh, and you can have three more familiars as well as the ones you use in battle.
Tidy! But what happens if we get all overexcited and tame more familiars than we've got room for?
Then you'll have to speak to a little friend of mine!<NL>Look over there a second.
What a funny-looking little thing!<NL>Is he a familiar, too?
Ohh, there's useful! Looks like you'll be keeping busy then, eh, Esther?
I'm looking forward to it! I can't wait to see what kinds of creatures there are out there to tame!
You can find Familiar Retreat holes in every town you visit, and even in some dangerous places, too.
I think I've seen some in places we've been already...
Hang on! Look! Your familiar's ready to metamorphose!
Meta...what?
Blimey! I have to teach you about that as well, do I?<NL>You don't know anything! Fine! I'll teach you about <color:#1>metamorphosis</color>, too.
But give me a break first, will you? Explaining this is going to give me face-ache.

evc0420_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Right. It's time to teach you about <color:#1>metamorphosis</color>.<NL>This is boring, so listen carefully.<NL>I'm not explaining it again.
If you look, you can see your familiar wants<NL>to metamorphose.
And for that one, you'll need...one of these. Here.
Is this...some kind of treat?
That's not just any old treat. Look, just try it, will you?<NL>I'm bored of talking.
Give it to that <color:#1>mite</color> you've got there.
Feed it to him in the Creature Cage, you mean?<NL>Okay, here goes...

evc0430_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Neato! Look at my familiar!
That's <color:#1>metamorphosis</color>. When a familiar gets big enough, you can feed it special <color:#1>treats</color> to make it change into a<NL>new version.
Metamorphosis! Got it!
Now, you don't need anything else explaining, do you? You're fine with what I've told you, right?
Yes, Master Solomon!
Good. I hate explaining all that stuff.
Anyway, if you want to hear all the boring details again, you can just ask that boring old Telling Stone you've<NL>got there.
Did somebody say my name?
Eek!
It is as His Supremacy says—I can replicate his explanations in minute detail at any time you choose.<NL>You need only ask, and—
BOOORING! Ugh, you haven't changed...
Anyway, now you know how it all works, you can<NL>get out there and tame loads of familiars and<NL>make them metamorphose.
Thank you very much, Your Honor!
Ta, Youer Supremitude!<NL>Right, where to next, then?
Can we go back to Al Mamoon quickly?<NL>I want to see how my father is getting on.
Sure! We can ask him about the other Great Sages, too!
Good-bye, Master Solomon!<NL>Thanks for everything!
Don't mention it.<NL>I mean it—shut up and get lost!

evc0450_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Knickers!<NL>That en't good!
Oh no!<NL>Old Smoky is erupting!
Old Smoky?
It's a volcano over to the west of Al Mamoon—<NL>proper huge, it is!
I'm no scientist, but I reckon it's the reason this whole region is so nice and warm.
But it shouldn't be erupting. There's a massive great big boulder blocking the crater to stop that from happening.
Jeepers...<NL>Do you think it's come loose somehow?
After all these hundreds of years? Not without some serious encouragement, it hasn't.
There's nothing in the old stories about it ever having been dislodged before...
Then it's an unprecedented disaster we've got on ouer hands, is it? ...Crikey, Al Mamoon could be in danger!
We have to go to Old Smoky!
What?
We have to put the boulder back, and stop the volcano from erupting!
Youer joking, en't you? It's hot as flipping flip up there, mun! The desert by here is arctic by comparison!<NL>We'll be burnt to cinders!
But...didn't you bring me here to save the world?
We have to go! We have to save Al Mamoon!
He's right! We passed the Trials, didn't we?<NL>We can do this!
Why, you little...
...You little beauties! It's enough to make a grown fairy cry, seeing how far you've come!
All right, I'm game! Let's save the day!<NL>Onward, to <color:#1>Old Smoky</color>!
All right!<NL>Let's go!

evc0460_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So this is Old Smoky. Jeepers...<NL>The whole mountain is on fire!
Wow. I've always seen it from town, but I've never been this close before...
Well, don't stand there gawping—it en't exactly what you might call safe round by here. That's why people and fairies tend to steer clear.
And anywhere us lot give a wide berth, you can bet beasties will flipping love! Brace youerselves—<NL>we're in for a bumpy ride!
Watch out for the lava, Oliver!<NL>I doubt even a wizard could survive falling into that!
Don't worry, I'll be real careful. If we all work together, we'll make it through this—just like we made it through the Trials!
You're right!
There's inspirational!<NL>Tidy, let's crack on then, shall we?<NL>Don't stop till you reach the top!

evc0475_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
What the—!?<NL>That was one huge tremor!
Ohhh, knickers!<NL>Knickers, knickers, knickers!
What's wrong, Mr. Drippy?
The big one is on the way!<NL>I can feel it in my lantern!<NL>This old boy's about to blow!
You can really tell?
'Course I can! I'm Lord High Lord of the Fairies, en't I? Volcano-eruption-sensing's child's play for the likes of me, mun!
Then we have to hurry!<NL>We have to stop it!
Youer not wrong, mun. We'll be toast if we don't.<NL>Come on, to the top with you!

evc0480_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Whoa! That was a big one!
Knickers, knickers, knickers, knickers! If we don't stop the old boy erupting soon, we can kiss ouer sorry behinds good-bye!
Then let's stop it!
That's easier said than done, Ollie-boy! If my seventh sense is to be trusted, we've got...
Knickers! <color:#1>Three minutes</color>! <color:#1>Three flipping minutes</color>!<NL>By crikey, only <color:#1>three</color>!? <color:#1>Three</color>, mun!? <color:#1>Threeeeeeee</color>!?
So we've got three minutes, I take it...<NL>Hang on! That's no time at all!<NL>Are you absolutely sure?
Do I look like I'm flipping messing about!? <color:#1>Three minutes</color>, I said, and <color:#1>three minutes</color> I meant! <color:#1>Three short minutes</color> to stop this thing erupting!
Don't worry, Mr. Drippy!<NL>We'll make it, I-I know we will!<NL>Come on, we have to hurry!

evc0489_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Nearly there, mun!
Seems like as good a place as any to stop the old Drippy clock! Let's see now... There we go.
But...I thought you said we only had three minutes?<NL>I distinctly remember you saying it. Several times, in fact.
Well, yes, I did, but...<NL>It was more of an estimate, see?<NL>To give you something to work towards, like.
What!? But—
I guess it helped us get here quicker, huh, Mr. Drippy?
Exactly! That's what I meant, en't it?
But you made us think that—! Hmph!<NL>Never mind. I suppose at least we're here now.<NL>We'd better go and have a look at the crater.
Come on!

evc0490_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
On top of Old Smoky at last...
Wow...<NL>It's like... It's like the end of the world.
Crikey, look at the boulder, mun!<NL>It's just like I said! It's come unstuck!<NL>How the heck did that happen?
Gee, I don't know, Mr. Drippy.<NL>I guess we'll just have to put it back, huh?
Wait! Look! What's that?
You came, boy. As I knew you would...
Is that...?
Crikey!<NL>It's flipping Sh-Sh-Shadar!!!
<KEEP>
Shadar?
Huh...!?
I have a little trial of my own for you...
A-Aaah! Aaaaaaaaahhh!!!
Huh?
Aaah!

evc0500_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Aiii!

evc0501_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
The smoke has stopped...<NL>I think we fixed it.
You did it, Oliver!<NL>You saved Al Mamoon!
Yeah...<NL>But what about Shadar?
Don't go getting ahead of youerself, mun! Youer nowhere near ready to face him yet! Didn't you feel the power coming off him? Terrifying, it was!
I was so worried he was going to steal a piece of my heart again—but he just sort of left us alone, didn't he?
Well, I wouldn't say that, exactly. He was the one controlling that fiery guardian, and you can bet this whole mess was thanks to him, and all!
You really think all this was Shadar's work?
'Course it was! Who else would do something so flipping rotten! I reckon we had a lucky escape!
I had no idea... Thank you so much for sealing the volcano back up, Oliver.
B-but...<NL>You don't need to thank me, Esther!
Of course I do! Without you, my hometown could have been destroyed! You saved the people of Al Mamoon<NL>from disaster!
But, Esther, you...
You weren't exactly standing on the sidelines, were you? Don't let old pure-heart here take all the glory!
...I suppose I did help a little.<NL>Thank you!
Well, shall we head back to Al Mamoon?<NL>I want to tell my father all about our adventure!
Sure! Let's go tell him how brave you were!

evc0510_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Mr. Rashaad!
You have returned! Does this mean you have completed the Trials?
Yes, Sir! And Master Solomon taught us a whole bunch of neat stuff!
I am happy for you. But this is no time for celebrations. The city is in grave danger. The volcano is—
Don't worry youer pretty little head about that, Youer Sageship! We sorted that out too while we were at it!
You...? But— How?
It's quite a story, Father!<NL>You see...
So...not only did you succeed in completing the Trials, you also prevented the volcano from erupting? That is quite a tale.
It would seem that your potential is even greater than I had imagined.
But for Shadar himself to have appeared... It seems his game has entered its next phase. I must look into this...
Thank you, Mr. Rashaad, Sir!<NL>We should get back to our journey!
Do we have to, Ollie-boy? I'm flipping knackered, mun! Can't we stop by here for a bit and have a nice babana<NL>or two?
There's no time, Mr. Drippy!<NL>Other towns could be in danger!
Mr. Rashaad—I need to learn more magic!<NL>I need more powerful spells!
You have proven your ability. You overcame the Trials, and saved the city. I have nothing more to teach you.
You will learn more, Oliver. But you will learn much of it for yourself, as your journey continues.
...I will?
Yet...there is a limit to what can be learned without instruction... Very well. You must visit my fellow<NL>Great Sages.
And you must learn what they have to teach you.
He's right, Ollie-boy! Shadar is one tough cookie—you'll need all the help you can get if youer going to beat him!
But where can we find the other Great Sages?
Alicia, she who once fought alongside me, fell foul of Shadar, and her soul was sealed away...
But there are two more.<NL>They are out there somewhere...
There's useful. "Somewhere," eh?<NL>Ta, Sageface! Fat lot of use you are!
I do not know their exact whereabouts. But I believe one of them resides in the city of <color:#1>Hamelin</color> on the continent<NL>of Autumnia.
Hamelin, huh?<NL>Thank you, Mr. Rashaad, Sir!
Autumnia... That's far away to the east.<NL>You'll need a boat to get there...
So you'll need to go via <color:#1>Castaway Cove</color>.<NL>It's the closest port.
To reach it, you must cross the desert to the south of here.
Cross the desert to the south, huh? Is it far away?
Don't worry, Oliver! I'll show you the way!
Esther! You mean...?
Yes! I'm coming with you!<NL>We travel together from now on!
But... Are you sure?
Of course I am! We're both fighting for the same thing, aren't we?
And you already know how helpful<NL>having me around can be!
You bet I do!
But... Mr. Rashaad...<NL>Is it all right if Esther comes with us?
Hm. I know my daughter. There is no stopping her when she sets her mind on something. I have little choice but<NL>to agree.
Esther... You must make yourself useful to Oliver.<NL>You must not become a burden to him.
Of course I won't!<NL>I'm a Great Sage's daughter!
Hm! Truly, you are.
Then it is decided.<NL>Oliver, please take care of my daughter.
I will, Sir!
He'll look after me—won't you, Oliver?
Oh, and I'm sure you will too, Drippy!
Welcome aboard!
Oh, I'm an afterthought, is it? Righto. I can see how this is going to work out...
Still, I suppose you do brighten the place up a bit...<NL>Go on, then. The more the merrier, I s'pose.
Well, Father...I had better be going.
Take care, Daughter.<NL>May the Ancients watch over you.
Thank you, Mr. Rashaad!<NL>We'll come visit you again real soon, I promise!

evd0005_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Jeepers!
Stooop! Thief!
Huh? A thief? Where?
That man!<NL>He ran off with a huge pot!
Come back here!<NL>You must pay!
Someone has to stop him!<NL>It's daylight robbery!
Youer not going to let him get away with it, are you,<NL>Ollie-boy?
No way! We need to go after him!
That's the spirit! Proper brave, you are, mun!<NL>No wonder you passed them Trials!
Hee hee! I knew you'd say that, Oliver!<NL>Let's chase down that criminal!
All right! Come on!

evd0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Dammit!
There's no escape!
Give back what you stole!
What I stole?<NL>What are you on about?
What do you mean, what am I on about!?<NL>That great big pot, of course!
Pot...?<NL>Oh, this thing?
What's wrong with him, mun? It's like he doesn't even remember stealing it!
Ha! What do I want with this piece of rubbish?
If you want it...it's yours!
Aaah!
Huuuh?
Eeek!
Huh?
Ah!
Hm?
I'm sure it'll make you very happy.
Seeya!
Wh-What the—!?<NL>What was that all about?
Why would he steal something then just throw it away<NL>like that?
Yes, why would he?<NL>What was he thinking?
I don't reckon he was thinking at all, mun...
Huh? How do you mean?
Well, he en't bothered what he steals, it's just the stealing he's in it for, en't it?
You mean...he enjoys stealing for its own sake?
Yeah, that's about the size of it.<NL>I'm no expert, mind...
If that's really true, he's even more horrible than I thought!
Well, never mind that for the minute. Let's get this old pot back to that peddler, shall we? He must be worried sick, pooer fellow...
He must be, huh...<NL>Okay, let's take it back to him!

evd0014_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Uh, excuse me, Sir.<NL>I think this belongs to you.
Oh! Ah, indeed...<NL>You, ah, you recovered it?
Yes, we did. The thief got away, unfortunately, but we got your pot back for you.
(Curses...)
Ah, I mean...is that so?<NL>Y-You have my thanks...
Crikey, don't go being too grateful, will you?<NL>It's not like it's flipping heavy or anything!
Forgive me...<NL>It is just that...
I was rather pleased to have finally rid myself of it.
Huh?
The man you chased...he is a habitual thief.<NL>He does not care what he steals.
So, as ever, I called after him, "Stop, thief!"
But when I saw what he had taken, I gave thanks to<NL>the Ancients.
You gave thanks for being robbed?
In this instance, yes. You see, this pot...no matter how I try, it will not open. Therefore, I cannot use it to store<NL>my wares...
It is of no use to me. ...Yes! You must take it!<NL>For apprehending the thief! It is the least I can do!
You're giving it to us?<NL>Just like that?
Hold on a second! You just told us it's flipping useless, and now youer pretending youer doing us a favor giving it to us? What's going on, mun?
Ah, um...perhaps you will think of it as a souvenir of your visit to Castaway Cove, Jewel of the Seven Seas! Ahem...
A souvenir? A great big pot like this?
Yes. A most wondrous souvenir. It is no ordinary pot,<NL>after all.
If the rumors are to be believed, it was once used by an ancient royal family. It has an illustrious and regal history.
But if that's true, we can't accept it.<NL>It's too valuable...
B-But you must! I am so grateful to you! So very grateful for your help! Think nothing of it! Go now! Take it! Go! Begone!
Uh, okay...
You said yes!? What did you do that for, mun?
What do you mean, Mr. Drippy?<NL>Did I do something wrong?
I mean, he looked as if he was going to cry if I didn't take it... He seemed real worried...
I-Indeed! I was worried! Worried that you would, er...think me ungrateful! Yes! That is what I was worried about! Thank you so very much!
Something funny is going on here...
Come on, tell us! There's something wrong with this pot, isn't there?
Wh— Wrong!?<NL>Why, of course not!
It is simply that the lid will not open, and...perhaps,<NL>now and again...spine-chilling clatterings emanate<NL>from within...
But only every once in a while...<NL>It is nothing!
Ah ha ha ha! Ah ha...ha...
So the lid won't open, but strange sounds come from inside it?
What could that mean?
Aha! So that's it, is it?<NL>Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!
Huh? You know why it won't open, Mr. Drippy?
Nah, mun! It'll open!<NL>You just need to know how, en't it?
It's a <color:#1>cauldron</color>, see?
Really? This is a cauldron?<NL>Wow...
You know what that is?
Yes! I've never seen one, but my father used to have one.
All wizards have a cauldron, you see.
They do?
That they do, Ollie-boy! And the reason it won't open is because it's sealed up tight with powerful magic!
But all it needs is for a true wizard to say the <color:#1>magic words</color> written in the <color:#1>Wizard's Companion</color>, and—alakazam!—the lid'll pop off just like that!
It will, huh?
Oliver! You should try to open it!
I should?<NL>Right now?
Why not, mun? There's no time like the present!<NL>Go on, give it a go!
O-Okay... So the magic words are in the Wizard's Companion, huh? Let me take a look...

evd0015_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You are very small, Master.
Aah!
Wh—?
Huh?
...Huh!?
But it matters not!
Your right to command me will be judged...<NL>in battle!
<KEEP>
Huh? Where? Where is it?
Aha! Now, to arms!

evd0016_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Haa... Haa...<NL>Why would he just attack us like that...?
Phew...<NL>Are you all right, Oliver?
Ho! Your name is Oliver, Master?
I-I'm sorry?
Oh, most illustrious Master Oliver!<NL>Your prowess in battle is unsurpassed!
Graceful, fearsome, yet merciful! Truly, you are a master worthy of Al-Khemi, Genie of the Pot!
Genie?
That's right, Ollie-boy! Every cauldron has a <color:#1>genie</color> inside it, see?
They do what's known as <color:#1>alchemy</color> for you. But they have to test you first, to see if youer worthy, en't it?
That's why the big red bruiser started on you. Nothing personal, like—if youer after a cauldron, it's the only way.
It's traditional, see?
Gee, you could have warned me, Mr. Drippy...
Hm! When first I laid eyes on you, Master, your diminutive size worried me most prodigiously.
But you have humbled me! You have reminded me that a book may never be judged by its cover! No matter how unimpressive it may be...
I bow to you, Master!<NL>Now and forever more!
Pleased to meet you, too!
Master, I must pay you tribute.<NL>Please, accept these humble gifts!
You must combine these items with the power of alchemy! They will produce a most wondrous and magical result!
And for this, your first alchemical experiment, I present you also with a formula! Behold!

evd0017_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Everybody here is wearing a swimsuit, huh?
Yes! No wonder they call it the Seaside Paradise<NL>of the South!
Look! They are not dressed correctly!
Tut! So very disrespectful...
Wh— Huh?
Knickers!<NL>It's like Ding Dong Dell all over a-flipping-gain!
Jeepers...
Come now! What is this disturbance?
Ah! Governor!<NL>The very person we need!
What do we have here, hm?<NL>You are visitors to our town, I take it?
You must know that all who enter this place are required by law to wear the appropriate attire. I speak, of course, of the bathing suit.
Uh...
But we en't planning on moving here, is it?<NL>We're just passing through, like!
Nonetheless, the law must be obeyed. The dark days of the past cannot be revisited. We once had great<NL>trouble here...
I'm sorry to hear that...
You'd never think it to look at the place now.<NL>It's so peaceful...
It was a time of great sadness. Travelers from all over our world sail to Castaway Cove. Travelers who do not always see eye to eye...
The men of the sea are hearty, but quick-tempered. Without constant supervision, they would soon fall upon one another in anger.
And for this reason, I devised a means of maintaining<NL>the peace.
I am sure you have guessed already what it was...
Um...
Yes! To require all those in the town to wear bathing suits, of course!
What is he, flipping crackers or something?<NL>What difference would that make?
A great difference indeed, fairy! For in a bathing suit, one cannot conceal a weapon! Ho ho ho!
And no matter where their homeland may be, all who come here must dress in the same manner.
Be they from Al Mamoon, from Ding Dong Dell, or from the furthest-flung islands of the north...
...when they don the bathing suit, they become citizens of Castaway Cove.
Wow, that's...interesting... But it's such a strange idea.<NL>How did you convince everyone to agree?
Ho ho ho! At first, of course, I met with ridicule from all sides! None would support my scheme...
But I did not waver. I remained true to my vision.<NL>I put away my resentment and my frustration.
And why was I able to show such restraint? Because I had a dream! A dream of peace in the place of my birth.
Gee... I thought they were dressed like that because it was so hot...
Hee hee! Me too!
Ho ho ho! You are not the first to think so! But this only proves how peaceful our town has become! Such a misunderstanding is a happy one!
I understand now. We should respect the Governor's wishes and dress like everybody else.
Let's do it! I want to become a citizen of Castaway Cove!
All right then, if we flipping must...<NL>But I en't got a swimsuit, have you?
Ho ho ho!<NL>Worry not, little one!
We have a great wealth of bathing suits prepared for visitors just such as yourselves! Come, you will follow me to my home!

evd0018_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Check me out, Ollie-boy!
I look the business in this little number!
Hm? Oh! There's marvelous!
What do you think?
Sorry I'm late!
We may be boys, but we en't entirely ignorant of the more involved nature of feminine dress. Eh, Ollie-boy?
Uh, I guess... Anyway, we're all citizens of Castaway Cove now! Let's go take a look around!
Thank you very much, Mr. Governor, Sir!
Ho ho ho!
The bathing suits are yours now.<NL>You must wear them whenever you visit us.
Now, at last I can say to you...
Welcome to Castaway Cove!
Thank you!
And now at last we can go and look for a flipping boat! Talk about a faff, mun...

evd0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Excuse me, Sir...<NL>Are you the captain of this ship?
That I am, lad!<NL>Captain and master of all who sail in her!
You have a beautiful boat, Captain!
You do not need to tell me that!<NL>She is the most beautiful on the seven seas!
There is not a finer or more fearsome ship afloat!
And her name is no less fine or fearsome, for she is the legendary Sea Cow!
I have something to ask you, Captain...<NL>Would you let us ride aboard your ship?
Hm? You seek passage aboard the Sea Cow?
We need to get to Autumnia!
Avast, girl!
You believe you can merely stroll aboard?<NL>Who do you think you are?
Well, Captain, I'm—
Well, Captain—and may I say what a fine captain you are—
The young man standing before you—and I know it seems unlikely, but bear with me—
This unassuming scrap of a lad here—Oliver, his name is—he is only on a journey to save ouer flipping world!
And he's only accompanied by none other than myself—Drippy, Lord High Lord of the Fairies!
...Oh, and I'm Esther.
You are a fairy? I have traveled the world, but never have I seen one of your kind before...
So, lad, you travel to save the world with a fairy for<NL>a companion?
Ha ha ha! Then surely my ship alone will not suffice!<NL>You will need two ships! A fleet, even! Ha ha ha!
Uh, does that mean we can ride with you?
But of course, boy! Just as soon as you have shown me a <color:#1>letter of passage</color> from our beloved Cowlipha, the most exalted Lowlah!
We sail, after all, for her glory, and for that of Al Mamoon!
Should the Cowlipha see fit to grant you permission to come aboard, I will refuse you nothing!
All right, Captain.<NL>We'll go get that letter right now.
Ha ha ha!<NL>Fine words, lad, but easier said than done, I fear!
Still, if you are truly to save our world, it should be the work of mere moments!
Ha ha ha!
...I don't think he believes us, does he?
It doesn't matter.<NL>We just have to prove him wrong.
If we can bring him that <color:#1>letter of passage</color>, he'll have to believe us!
Let's go back to <color:#1>Al Mamoon</color> and get it!
Cowlipha Lowlah, eh? I wonder what she's like...<NL>Looking forward to this, I am. I flipping love royalty, me!

evd0025_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So where do we need to go, exactly?
Weren't you listening, cloth-ears?<NL>To where the Cowlipha is, en't it?<NL>The palace, mun, the palace!
It's beyond the main square, Oliver!<NL>I'll show you the way!
Huh?
Hm?
Yikes!
What's wrong, Esther?
Nothing. I just had a funny feeling we were being followed for a second...
I'm sure it's nothing.
Sorry. Let's get going, shall we?
Sure!
By the beards of the Mighty! The regal lines, the majestic curve of the nostril... Your nose—it is in every respect the same! The same as hers!
I'm sorry?
Please, you must let me study it!
What?<NL>Who are you?
Ah! Forgive me! I am but a humble artist.<NL>I am currently painting the portrait of one to whom you bear a most striking resemblance.
I look like the person in your portrait?
Indeed! And alas, I am unable to meet her in the flesh! Will you not allow me to study you a little more?
Well, if you must...<NL>Go ahead.
Hmm...yes...<NL>Ahh, so it is more like this...
The line of the jaw is key! Yes, of course...<NL>Thank you! I am in your debt!
I know just what I must do to finish my masterpiece!<NL>You have my eternal gratitude!
Um, that's all right. You're very welcome.
I must return to my studio right away!<NL>Farewell!
Wow... I wonder who this person is who looks like me...
Whoever it is, that artist certainly seems to think she's rather beautiful...
Crikey, these arty types are a bit intense, en't it?<NL>Not to mention a bit flipping weird!
Hm? What do you mean?
Oh, nothing. Just that, you know, he was a bit of a funny one. Did you not think so? Just me, was it? Righto. I'll shut my big mouth, shall I...
So! Time to get moving, is it?
Sure! Let's go!

evd0030_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tidy! This here's the palace!<NL>Let's get ouerselves inside, shall we?
Halt! You may not pass!
You think you can just walk into the palace of our most revered Cowlipha unannounced?
What seems to be the problem here?
Master Abull!
These miscreants were attempting to enter the palace without permission!
Is that so? Wait—you are the babana merchant's daughter, are you not?
I am Abull, vizier to our esteemed Cowlipha. Your father's efforts to supply Her Magnificence with babanas are, as ever, most highly appreciated.
I had heard that you were...unwell.<NL>It seems that you are recovered.
Yes, I'm much better now, thank you!
That is excellent news.
Tell me, child—what business have you at the palace?
Well, Sir, you see, we need a ship, and we can't get one without a letter of passage from the Cowlipha!
You and your friends wish to journey to the lands across the sea...
I sympathize. And I would dearly love to arrange an audience for you. However...
Is something wrong?
I am afraid the Cowlipha is...indisposed. Much as it would please her, she is currently unable to hear the requests of any of her subjects.
Oh, that's too bad...
Apologies, but she has requested that she not be disturbed under any circumstances during her afternoon snack.
Then I guess we'll just have to wait until after that...
Would that you could, but her afternoon snack is immediately followed by her second lunch...
And after that?
Then comes her late afternoon snack...
Um...is there any time when she's not eating?
Alas, her Moojesty's miraculous hunger dictates that she dine even during her sleeping hours...
This is why I am forced to spend my every waking<NL>hour procuring her most beloved food... Ah!<NL>But I must be going!
Her most beloved food?<NL>I wonder what that could be...
Forgive me! I must make the necessary arrangements before the merchants' supplies are exhausted!
I am most terribly sorry that I am not able to grant you<NL>an audience.
Curses! I must hurry! If I cannot prepare Her Moojesty's next meal in good time, she will be most displeased!
Master Abull has spoken.<NL>Leave this place.
It looks like we don't have much choice, Oliver.<NL>Come on, we'll come back later.
So...the Cowlipha has a very special favorite food, is it?
Hey, I bet if we found out what it was and took her some of it as a present, we'd be allowed to see her!
That's a neat idea, Esther!<NL>But we don't know what her favorite food is...
Oi, oi, Ollie-boy!<NL>You know how we can find out, don't you!
Um...
Come on, slowcoach! We go to youer world and find her soul mate, en't it?
Of course! If we find her soul mate, we can find out what their favorite food is, and give some to the Cowlipha!
But how do we find out who the Cowlipha's soul mate is?
I've never seen her before...
Hmm, so we need to find out what the Cowlipha looks like, but we can't go and meet her...
But if we can't meet her, how are we supposed to find out what she looks like?
I saw her once in a parade when I was little, but it was so long ago, I can't remember anything about her...
So what do we do?<NL>Jeepers...
We don't know what the Cowlipha's favorite food is, and we don't know what she looks like...
I have to confess, I'm completely out of ideas, too.
Bah, all this thinking's making my head hurt, mun!<NL>Tell you what—let's go down the Cat's Cradle and sleep on it, shall we?
Well...I guess I am kinda tired...
The <color:#1>Cat's Cradle</color> is near the entrance to town.
Okay. Let's go rest awhile...

evd0033_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Welcome to the Palace of Pampurring,<NL>the cream of Cat's Cradle establishments—
<KEEP>
Oh my!
I— I must apologize...
Please, you must excuse me...
- Is it finished? Is it really finished?<NL>- It is indeed!
The paint is scarcely dry, but it is completed at last!
Isn't that the artist who...?
Yes it is.
I wonder how his picture turned out?
Ohhh, how I have longed to see it!<NL>Now, please hang it over here...
At last, the grand unveiling!
Oh, my beloved Cowlipha!
So the person he thought I looked like was...<NL>the Cowlipha?
There's fancy! It's not every day you get compared to royalty.
Now, feast your eyes upon the divine beauty of Her most admired Moojesty!
Huh?
But that's—
Oh, it is divine! Truly divine!<NL>Her matchless beauty takes one's breath away!
You are pleased with it?
Pleased? Why, it is worth thrice what I promised to pay you for it!
By the beards of the Mighty!<NL>Truly?
But we shook upon it, did we not?<NL>Purrhaps next time...
I, I see...
Excuse me!
Y-Yes?
I don't look anything like her!
Hm?
You said I looked like her!
Y-You misunderstand, young lady...<NL>It is not a picture of you, merely—
Mr. Drippy!
...Eh?<NL>What is it, mun?<NL>This is just getting interesting...
We need to go to Motorville right now!<NL>I just realized who we need to see!
You did, eh?
I sure did! <color:#1>Miss Leila</color> is the Cowlipha's soul mate, I just know she is!
Of course she is!<NL>There's clever of you, Ollie-boy!
Thanks, Mr. Drippy!<NL>When I saw that picture, I knew right away!
Righto, let's get moving then, shall we?<NL>I don't feel tired all of a sudden!
Me either!
Hey, Esther!<NL>Come on, we have to go!
...Huh?
Hmph!<NL>I look absolutely nothing like her!
Do I look that fat to you?<NL>I am not fat! Harrumph!
You're still kinda angry, huh...
What do you mean!?<NL>I'm not angry in the slightest!
Yeah, and I'm six foot flipping six!<NL>Looks like we'd best leave her to it...
I guess we should, huh...

evd0040_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Looks like the shop en't open yet...
I'm sure if we wait right here, she'll be along soon.<NL>It's time to open up already.
Someone's coming!
Oh, hello, Oliver!
Myrtle! Hi!
How are you?<NL>Are you feeling better now?
I am! And it's all thanks to you, Oliver! What are you doing here? Do you need something from the store?
Wait a moment, I'll just open up for you!
Who's this girl?<NL>I feel like...
Like you know her somehow?
Yes! And she looks just like me!<NL>It's like she's my long-lost twin or something!
She looks much more like me than the stupid<NL>old Cowlipha!
Hm? Can she not see me or something?
There's perceptive of you.<NL>She can't see you, nor me neither.
Really...? So I'm invisible?<NL>What a strange feeling...
Of course youer invisible!<NL>Youer from another world, en't it?
Huh? Did you say something, Oliver?
Uh, no. No I didn't...
Anyway, how come you're here at Miss Leila's<NL>store, Myrtle?
Hee hee! I work here now!
Miss Leila and my mom are friends, and when she heard that I was better, she said I should come work for her.
Gee, that's real nice of her...
Say, Myrtle, is Miss Leila around?
Sure. She's busy training right now, but I'm sure she'll be back soon.
Wh— Miss Leila?<NL>Training?
That's right.<NL>She's started running.
Is she on a diet?
Hee hee! No, silly! She's exercising so that she can eat even more!
Huh?<NL>How do you mean?
Haa... Haa...<NL>Myrtle! I'm back!
Why, if it isn't young Oliver!<NL>Hello, dearie!
G'morning, Miss Leila!
Myrtle!<NL>I can't wait any longer! Would you...?
Yes, Miss Leila!<NL>I'll go get it for you right now!
Oh, it's no good! I just can't wait that long! I have some in the store, dear. You stay out here and clean or something...
My! I never saw anybody so crazy about their<NL>favorite food...
What was that?<NL>Did she say "favorite food"?
Oi, Ollie-boy—I bet it's the same as the Cowlipha's!
You're right!<NL>Let's go find out what it is!
See you soon, Myrtle!

evd0045_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Om nom nom nom nom...
Miss Leila...!
What is she eating?
It's cheese...
A whole lot of cheese!
That's right, dearie.
And it's not for sale—none of it!<NL>It's all for little old me!

Quick, Ollie-boy!
She'll scoff the whole lot<NL>if youer not careful!
Hurry up and grab some!<NL>Sharpish!
Okay...
Please, Miss Leila...
Could you give me a piece of your cheese...
Uh-uh-uuh!
You know I'd do anything for you dearie, but not that!<NL>Oh no, no, no...
P-Please! Just one piece!<NL>Just one...tiny...little...piece!
Pull, Oliver! Go on, pull!
Heave, mun!<NL>Heave with all youer might!
It's mine, I tell you!<NL>All miiine!

evd0046_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It's kind of a shock, huh?
It sure is.<NL>I had no idea...
I had no idea she was so...obsessed...
Hee hee! It's better not to go near her when she's<NL>eating cheese!
I know that now...
Myrtle? Myrtle!
It sounds like she needs my help.
I'd better go inside.<NL>Good-bye now!
Jeepers...<NL>So what do we do now?
Miss Leila's store is the only place in town that<NL>sells cheese...
Oliver!<NL>What's wrong?
Oh, hi Pea...
We kinda need some cheese...
..."Cheese"?
That's right.<NL>It's the Cowlipha's favorite food...
Who's he talking to?
Must be his imaginary friend again.<NL>Here we flipping go...
Huh? We can make it?<NL>Make our own cheese?
Yes!<NL>With your magic!<NL>Lots and lots of cheese!
But I can't...<NL>I don't know how...
Yes you do!<NL>Just try!
"Just try"?<NL>You think it's really that easy?
Yes!
But do I even have a spell I can use to do that?<NL>...Hey! Wait!
She's gone...
Have fun talking to youer imaginary friend, did you,<NL>Ollie-boy? Better than talking to youer real friends,<NL>was it?
Huh? Imaginary friend?
You mean Pea?
Pea?<NL>Who's that?
What do you mean?<NL>She was right here!
Um...<NL>I didn't see anyone...
Maybe only you can see her, Oliver.
Really?<NL>But how come?
Well, maybe it's just like how Myrtle can't see me, but I can see her.
You might be right, you know.<NL>I've never seen this Pea either...
Anyway, what did Pea say to you, Oliver?
Oh yeah! She told me to use my magic to make<NL>some cheese!
What's that? Make it with magic, you say? Well, she may be too shy to let us see her, but she en't afraid to stick her neck out advice-wise...
You mean it won't work?
Nah, mun, it'll work! The whole point of magic is to make the impossible possible, en't it?
But I guess it's difficult without the right ingredients, huh?
But we do have them!
We do?
Of course we do! Back in Al Mamoon—the<NL><color:#1>fountains of milk</color>!
So we use magic to turn the milk from the fountains<NL>into cheese...
Now that we can do!<NL>Tidy!
Righto, Ollie-boy!<NL>Let's get back to ouer world, shall we?
Yes, let's go straight to the <color:#1>fountains of milk</color> and try it out!
They're in the main square back in Al Mamoon!

evd0050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So these are the fountains of milk?<NL>Gee, is that real milk? For real?
Hee hee!
Of course! The freshest, creamiest milk there is! And there's so much of it, you can just keep trying until you get it right!
Keep trying?<NL>You think I can't do it, huh?
I didn't mean anything by it! Come on, you've got to conjure up some cheese. Focus.
Now, do you know how cheese is made?
Sure, you heat some milk, then you add lemon and salt, and you skim the solid part off of the top, and it turns<NL>into cheese.
Blimey! A regular cheesemonger, you are!<NL>This should be cheesy-peasy, then!<NL>All you need is the right spell, en't it?
Sure.<NL>Let me take a look...

evd0052_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look at that!<NL>It's flipping working!
It really is!<NL>You're so good at magic, Oliver!
I bet you could even make sweets if you put your mind to it! And cakes! Ooh, I could just eat a—
Hey, stop that!<NL>I'm trying to concentrate!
Wow!
Ah!
Jeepers!
Blimey!
Look at the flipping size of that, mun!<NL>And you went and made some sweets and all!
That was Esther's fault...
Hee hee! I bet you wanted some too though, didn't you?
You shouldn't distract somebody when they're trying to cast a spell...
Oh, don't be like that. Now we can go and see the Cowlipha! Our present's a little on the large side, but I don't suppose it will matter.
The bigger the better, I reckon!<NL>Let's please her with cheese!

evd0060_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
(snoring)
Jeepers!<NL>That's the Cowlipha!?
<KEEP>
She probably ended up this way because of—
Shadar, the stinking rotbag!
What is that divine aroma?
Abull!
Here, Your Moojesty!
Bountiful Cowlipha, these humble servants come bearing most delicious tribute.
Heavens! What a dear, sweet child.
Bring it to us now, there's a good boy!
Please.
Huh? You want me to take it to her?
Mm.
Quickly now, young man—bring it to us!
Hurry!
「舌ペロペロ、ワクワク、鼻ウガウガ、ヒャー！！」

Delicious cheesy-weese.
Do you have more for us?
More?
Mooore!<NL>Bring us mooore!
<KEEP>
Magnanimous Cowlipha, if you continue to eat so prodigiously, I fear you may burst.
Abull!<NL>We are hungryyy!
Your request does not go unheard, Moojesty,<NL>but I fear for Your Bovinity's well-being...
That there is one udderly broken heart!
What?
But...
She might not look brokenhearted...
...but depending on which bit of heart is missing,<NL>all manner of weird things can happen, see?
What Her Moojesty's lacking right now<NL>is a drop of restraint.
Restraint?
That's right. And without it, she can't control the urge to stuff her right royal face.
We won't be getting any favors out of her until<NL>we've sorted this out, you mark my words.
Okay.
So we need to find some restraint somewhere, huh?
There's quick of you, Ollie-boy!
You have been paying attention after all!
Let's go then, shall we?
Please, you must do all you can to help Her Moojesty.

evd0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
<color:#1>Restraint</color>, huh? Can you think of anyone with a lot of restraint, Esther?
Hmm, let me see...<NL>There must be someone...
We can use the Locket to try and look for someone, but this is a big old town, mun. Let's try the shopkeepers first, shall we?
That's a neat idea, Mr. Drippy! The people who own the shops know everybody in the town, and they hear all their news, too.
They do, don't they? Great!<NL>Let's ask around all the shops, then!
Yeah? Oh, is that so?<NL>Well, well, well...
So they got into the palace, did they?<NL>And what did they talk about...?
Did they, now?<NL>Okay, keep me posted on what's going on inside.
And...my payment?
Don't worry—you'll get your reward. By the next time we meet, I'll have scored you something decent.
Do you mean that you will...steal something?
No, no, don't be stupid!<NL>It's just a figure of speech!
Now concentrate on the job at hand, will you?<NL>I'm counting on you to be my eyes and ears.<NL>Don't let me down.

Upsidaisy!
Wh— Oh, we— Aah! Why— Goodness! Ohhh!
Aaah!
Crikey!
Mmmyaahhhh!
Goodness! We feel...quite marvelous!<NL>Whatever can have happened to us?
<KEEP>
These humble servants made Your Moojesty's ailing heart whole again.
I pray that our beloved Cowlipha's most<NL>generous appetite has now abated?
Well now, we still wish to enjoy the...<NL>finer things in life, of course...
...but we have come to feel that a measure of gastronomic restraint may serve to set a good example for our<NL>dearest subjects.
Your words are music to the ears of your people.<NL>Al Mamoon can return to its former magnificence.
Indeed it can. <NL>And we are simply itching to return to our labors!
Munificent Cowlipha... Should these humble servants not be rewarded for their services to Al Mamoon?
Indeed they should.<NL>Boy, is there something you desire?
Yes, Your Moojesty. If it's not too much trouble...
Well? What is it?
We'd like to borrow your ship.
..."Ship"?
Oh, our little floaty-woaty?<NL>Yes, of course.
But of course you may borrow it.<NL>It is of little use to us.
We will write a letter to the captain ordering him<NL>to help you in any way he can.
You will? Gee!
Thank you, Your Moojesty!
Tidy! The boat is in the bag!
But why in the world would a dear little thing like you have need of our floaty-woaty? Here...
Thank you, Your Moojesty.
Well? We asked you a question, did we not?
Well, uh...
Go on, mun.
...Okay.
We need to find one of the Great Sages.
The Great Sages? Mmm... Yes, we are aware of them. Abull, we know of them, do we not?
Indeed, most learned Cowlipha. But little has been heard of such men since the magical arts fell from favor.
Why do you seek the Great Sages, travelers?
We need their help.<NL>We need their power to defeat...Shadar.
Huh! What!?
Oh!
Is... Is something wrong?
We are not unamused!
But we can see that you speak in earnest.<NL>Very well...we will tell you what we know.
You will? I can't wait to hear it!
There were once four Great Sages.<NL>We understand that one of them was defeated by Shadar.
Mom...
Awww...
But we know of one who did not perish.
You do?
Well!
He lives in the land of <color:#1>Hamelin</color>—<NL>a detestable and warlike realm.
Ah, but he is a handsome young thing!<NL>We even keep a picture of him!
Abull!
Crikey, sounds like she's got<NL>a bit of a crush on the pooer lad!
So this is one of the Great Sages, huh?
That's a clue and a half, that is, Ollie-boy!<NL>There's lucky!
Hm hm hm!<NL>Now, before you take your leave, we shall teach<NL>you some magic to aid you on your journey.
Really?<NL>You're a wizard too, Your Moojesty?
Hm hm hm!<NL>Well, not a fully fledged wizard, perhaps, but...
We royals all know a few select spells. King Tom undoubtedly has a trick or two up his own kingly sleeves.
He sure does!<NL>He taught me some real neat magic!
Hm hm. How quaint. We hope that you will find our own still "neater." Here.
Oh yeah, mun...<NL>That's a cracker, that is... A real classic, like.
It's your lucky day, Oliver!
Yeah!
May it serve you well.
Do be careful out there now, won't you?
Yes, Your Moojesty!<NL>Thank you, Your Moojesty!

evd0110_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Righty-ho! First things first—let's go and let that captain know we're back, shall we?
If he lets us straight onto the boat, we won't have to change into our bathing suits, huh?
...Really? That's a shame.<NL>I was starting to rather like mine.
I can't wait to go over there, hand over that letter of passage, and show Captain Smugpants who's boss!
Let's do it! We have the clue to help us find the next Great Sage—we're all set!
It's funny though, isn't it? That someone so young could be a sage, I mean. He's so much younger than my father...
And a darned sight more handsome, and all! Ha!
We need to get to Hamelin right away.<NL>Come on, let's go see the Captain!
Heh heh!<NL>I'll have that, thank you very much!
Him again!
No! The picture!<NL>It's gone!
What!?
And the letter of passage, too!<NL>He stole them both!
Crikey, he's a pain in the neck, that one!<NL>Come on then, we'd best get after him, en't it?

evd0120_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look!<NL>It's him!
I told you to get this boat moving!
The letter of passage does not belong to you.<NL>I know you, thief. You stole it. From whom?
Who cares? Just shut up and let me on board, will you? I've got the letter, that means I get to ride on the ship.<NL>I know my rights!
Now, are you going to take me to Autumnia or not? Well?
Belay there, friend. There is no need to be so agitated. What is so urgent that it may not wait for a<NL>favorable wind?
I need to find him!<NL>I need to tell him...
"Him"? Who is this "him"?
Listen, I just have to go there and see someone, okay?<NL>He's doing it all wrong...
So I have to go and show him how to do it right!<NL>Come on! Take me there!
You are known in this town. Why would I let one such as you aboard my precious ship?
Grr... Listen, I have to get there, all right? If anything happens to him because you won't take me, I'll...<NL>You won't forget it in a hurry.
Save your empty threats, and tell me instead of<NL>whom you speak. Why would you have me take<NL>you to him?
Gah! None of your business!<NL>Now shut up and get this boat moving!
Stop!<NL>Give us back our things!
Dammit!<NL>Not you again...
You have returned, lad!<NL>Well met!
Wait...the letter of passage...it is yours?
Yes, Captain!<NL>He stole it from us!
Just as I thought. The Cowlipha would never grant such a privilege to a common criminal! Begone!
So does that mean you're not going to take me?<NL>But... But... Can't you see...?
Can't you see, it's all for him?<NL>I have to get to the Empire!<NL>Aaargh!!!
What is this?
Careful, Ollie-boy!<NL>Something's not right here!
That black mist...<NL>It's another Nightmare!
A Nightmare?<NL>Oliver, what does that mean?
Be careful, Esther!<NL>It's going to attack!
What?<NL>Oh no...
Ngh... Nnnnnngh... Aaaaaaaaah!!!
Goodness...
Jeepers!

evd0140_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ow...<NL>Hang on... Where am I?
You got taken over by a Nightmare, mun. Think it might have made you have a bit of a funny turn, like.
Can we have our picture back now?
Shut up, all of you!<NL>Get away from me!
If you come one step closer, I'll...<NL>I'll tear your precious picture into tiny pieces!
Jeepers!<NL>What should we do, Mr. Drippy?<NL>I think he's still heartbroken...
What's he missing though, I wonder...
Ahh, I get it! Same as the Cowlipha, en't it? He's got no <color:#1>restraint</color>, so he can't help himself, he just runs around pinching things willy-nilly!
So we need to find some more <color:#1>restraint</color>, do we?
But where do we look?<NL>Abull already shared his with us...
This is where youer <color:#1>Locket</color> comes in handy, en't it, Ollie-boy? Castaway Cove en't too big—we'll find some restraint in no time!
Let's start looking then, shall we?
I don't care what you do, just do it somewhere far away from me! Go on, get lost!

evd0150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So it's the Governor, huh?
He's the one with <color:#1>restraint</color> to spare, is it?
...'Course he is, mun! Makes sense, en't it? Think how patient he had to be to get them all to come round to his bathing suit idea!
Is something troubling you, friends?
Oh. I see that you are not wearing your bathing suits.<NL>Did you tire of them so soon?
No, Sir, it's nothing like that. We were just about to board a ship and leave town, that's all.
Ho! A ship, you say?<NL>So you are dressed for travel? I see.
But our letter of passage was stolen, and now we need to ask you a favor, Mr. Governor, Sir...
I am sorry to hear of your misfortune...
What do you require of me?<NL>If it is within my power, I will do it.
Thank you very much, Mr. Governor, Sir!<NL>We need you to help us save somebody.
Coming to the aid of one in need?<NL>A very worthy goal...
But to help him, we need your strength, Sir...
My strength?
Yes, Sir. We need to give him back a piece of his heart that's missing.
No! One of the heartbroken?<NL>In our town? This cannot be!
Know what they are, do you?<NL>Tidy. Then we'll make this quick.
As you can see, this young man by here is a wizard—<NL>a wizard who can mend the brokenhearted, no less!
By the beards of the Mighty!
And the person we want to help has lost his powers<NL>of <color:#1>restraint</color>.
You have such incredible patience and forbearance, Governor. Would you mind sharing some of it to help mend someone's heart?
Hmm... This is unexpected...but of course.
Tell me what I must do, and I will do it.
Neato!<NL>Thank you so much, Mr. Governor!
Tidy!<NL>On with the show, Ollie-boy!

evd0170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hey! Give that back!
What's the matter?
It's just a portrait of some pretty boy.
No need to get your knickers in a twist.
It's important! It must be!
Why would you steal it if it wasn't?
Let's just say I can't have it doing the rounds.
Tell you what—I'll buy it off you.<NL>That's fair, right?
<KEEP>
No!
It's not for sale!
We need it!
Oh yeah?
Need it for what?<NL>Go on, this should be good.
If I tell you, will you give it back?
Er... I might...
It's a picture...of one of the Great Sages.
We need to find him.<NL>He's going to help us defeat Shadar.
You what?
What did you just say?
We're going to defeat Shadar.<NL>All of us. Together.
And we reckon this Great Sage might have some proper powerful magic, en't it?
Ollie-boy here's going to need it.
Okay, we told you why we need it.
Now give it back!
You lot think you can take down Shadar?
And you want to drag<NL>pretty boy here into it, too?
We sure do!
And he'll help us, I just know he will!
You must be even more gullible than you look.<NL>That or you're just plain stupid.
You realize nobody stands up to<NL>Shadar and survives, don't you?
Nobody...
Huh?
...Nothing.
Anyway, you don't stand a chance.
I think we do.
Eh?
Oliver made my father, Rashaad, believe again.
And he saved me, too.
Rashaad?
What, the Great Sage Rashaad?
The very same! And he's itching to take Shadar down now!
You're joking...<NL>If Rashaad is...
We're not joking.
...Fine. I give up.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but you lot have got me half convinced. ...All right, I'll take you.
I'll show you where to find him.
Wh—!?
Eh!?
You know him?
Yeah, a bit.
Neato! Thanks so much...
Uh...
I'm Swaine.
Good to meet you, kiddo.
I'm not a kid! I'm Oliver!
All right, all right, keep your hair on.
Good to meet you, Oliver.
I'm Esther.
Drippy, Lord High Lord of the Fairies!
So I guess we should set sail, huh?
This is so exciting, Oliver!
Oh, while we're doing the introductions...<NL>Out you come, boy!
Meet my familiar!
Wh— You have a familiar!?
You didn't steal it, did you?
No I did not, thank you very much!<NL>He's my familiar, fair and square!
And he packs a punch and a half, I can tell you!
Hmm. There's something I don't quite trust about this Swaine character. He's hiding something...
But it sure will be neat to have another friend on our journey! Especially one with a familiar!
Hey, I'm not just some idiot with a familiar, you know.
How about I show you what else I can do, since you don't seem to think I'm up to much?
Aha! Just what we need!<NL>That chest will do perfectly!
Oliver. Move round so you're closer to that chest over there, will you?
Give me a shout when you've got a good clear view of it.
I'm going to show you something that'll knock your<NL>socks off!

Heh heh.<NL>Here goes...

Not bad, eh? I don't get my hands dirty walking up and fiddling around with locks up close.
The real professionals just take aim from a comfortable distance and pocket the plunder with a pull of the trigger!
Professional whats, exactly?
Oh, shut it with the goody-goody stuff, will you?<NL>He'll be proper useful to have onside, this one.
Friends! We will soon set sail!<NL>All aboard!
Aye, aye, Captain!<NL>Come on, everybody!<NL>Let's go!
All right!
You lot don't hang about, do you?<NL>Fair enough. Let's get moving.
Tidy!<NL>Time to see the sea at last!

There you are!
Sorry, Sir.
We got a little sidetracked.
The preparations are complete!<NL>We sail immediately!

Aye, aye, Captain!
Weigh anchor!
Another voyage lies before us!<NL>My heart sings for the seas!
Set sail!
We're moving!
Hee hee!
Ahh, it's proper exciting, this is!
This is going to be fun...
「おおっ！」

Shadar...
Are you...struggling?
Hmph. And he spoke so highly of himself...
<KEEP>
Fool! Did he really think the guardian of the volcano could defeat the Pure-Hearted One?
Ha ha ha!
I fear our Executor may be a trifle...toothless.
Hm. Perhaps he forgot his orders?
Well, Shadar?
What next?
This time, I shall leave nothing to chance.<NL>This time, he will suffer by my own hand.
So, it has come to this at last!
And not before time!
Your Graces, silence please.
Very well, Shadar.
I will grant you a new power.
The power to summon the storm.
You honor me, Your Radiance.
This time, he will be destroyed.
Do not fail me, Executor.

evd1016_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It is a success, Master!<NL>Truly, a work of wonder!
Your cauldron is capable of many more such miracles! It can produce weapons, armor, medicines, and treasures of every kind!
You must take your Wizard's Companion in hand, and try all that the alchemical arts have to offer!
I will, Mr. Genie, Sir!<NL>Thank you very much!
I look forward most humbly to serving you, Master!<NL>Ha ha haaa!
There's useful, eh, Ollie-boy? Now we just need to bag ouerselves a boat, and all will be tidy!
Let's go, Mr. Drippy!

But first you will have to save yourself!

What the flipping heck is that big eye!
It's looking this way!
It is the Eye of the Storm!
Eye of the Storm?
Summoned by sorcery!
Curses! We will not escape these waters!
This must be...Shadar's doing!
Oh, you reckon, do you?
Hold on tightly!<NL>If the eye looks this way, we are doomed!
The damn thing already is!

Huh?
What's all right now?

The big bad eye...?
Of course! The Eye of the Storm!
What am I doing here!?
But... Shadar?

Your friends?
They're already there, Oliver!

But— Hey, wait a second!
Hurry up, slowcoach!

Pea?<NL>She's not here...
What's he on about?<NL>Oi, are you alive, or what?
Oh-ho!<NL>You are back with us at last!
Captain!
Heh. Looks like it'll take more than a gust of wind to keep you down!
Anyway, enough of the soppy stuff.<NL>Captain, is the ship in a fit state to sail?
Alas, she is not. The storm took a heavy toll on my beloved Sea Cow. Even with all hands on double shifts, repairs<NL>will take...
...at least one week.
What!? But that's ages!<NL>Gah! We must be the unluckiest people alive!
Do not say such things. That we are alive at all makes us luckier than any who have faced the Eye of the<NL>Storm before.
He's right. We were extremely lucky to survive.<NL>I bet it was because we had Oliver on our side.
Me? But I didn't do anything...<NL>Do you think it was...Pea?
Anyway, it doesn't matter... I couldn't beat Shadar...<NL>I couldn't save Alicia...
You speak of things unknown to me...<NL>But is it not enough that you are alive and well?
He's right, Oliver.<NL>Come on, cheer up!
I, I'll try. Thanks...
Good!<NL>Now, Captain—what can we do to help?
Ho ho! I appreciate your fire, young lady, but you must leave the work to we men of the sea.
Then it looks like we're on holiday! I suppose a few days of sunbathing wouldn't hurt...
Typical!
Huh?<NL>Has anybody seen Mr. Drippy?
Now that you mention it, no. You don't think he's been washed away, do you? Oh no—look.
Mr. Drippy!<NL>Are you okay?
Wh-What? What's that? What do you mean? Hm?<NL>I'm fine! 'Course I am!
Did you hit your head when we washed ashore or something? You're acting like a right weirdo.
Wh-What are you on about, mun?<NL>Is the boat fixed? Tell me it's fixed!<NL>Come on, let's get off this smelly old rock!
It's nowhere near fixed, and you know it!<NL>Come on, we need to keep ourselves occupied.<NL>Shall we have a look around the island?
Eh!? No! I mean, wh-why would you want to do that? Boring, it is! Deserted, I shouldn't wonder—and dangerous, too! Perilous, even!
Let's just stay by here and enjoy the view, shall we?<NL>Ahh, there's beautiful! Yeah. Nice.
Ah! Of course! Friends, we will soon run short of provisions. Perhaps you could go in search of sustenance for ourselves and our shipmates?
Of course, Captain!<NL>It's the least we can do!
Great!<NL>Come on, everyone, let's go!
Nah, mun! Wait, mun! You can't, mun!<NL>Didn't you hear me? It's dangerous!<NL>You'll be eaten a-flipping-live!
Look, fairy, I'm not mad keen myself, but we don't have much choice. We'll just have to grin and bear it, okay?

Oh you are, are you?<NL>There's kind of you!
Wh— And suddenly she's listening! Are you deliberately trying to wind me up or something? Honestly...

What is it now, mun?
Youer looking very slim these days, love...
What are you on about, mun? I'm exactly the same as last time you flipping saw me! Youer just saying things for the sake of it now...

Thank you so much!<NL>Our familiars will be very happy!
It's my pleasure, love! Oh, and while youer over by here, I've got something to ask you.
You do?<NL>What is it, Ma'am?
Sorry to spring this on you out of the blue, like, but...
You wouldn't mind taking a look at my guts, would you?
Huh!?
Wh—
Crikey! You don't get much more out of the blue than that, mun!
I'll thank you to keep youer clever comments to youerself! And I thought I told you to turn that flipping lantern off!
I can't flipping turn it off! And it's none of youer business what I do with it anyway! I'm a grown fairy!
Um...when you say "take a look at your guts," what do you mean exactly? Do you mean you'd like us to...to...go inside you and...um...look for something?
Something funny's going on here.<NL>Something I don't want any part of...
Well, what it is is, see...<NL>They're not coming out.
Huh?
Hm?
They're not coming out! The littlies, I mean! I give birth to all of them, see? I'm the mother of all fairies, en't it?
And there's a load in there now who should have come popping out a while back, but nothing! Not a peep! Desperate, I am!
I, I'm not sure I understand...
Right. It's like this, see? My mam here brings up all the littlies—that's baby fairies to you—inside her tummy.
And once they're big enough, out they pop! But it's so warm and comfy in there that sometimes the little darlings don't want to come out.
I've heard some strange things in my time, but this is...<NL>this is... I don't know what this is.
I know, love. It is proper strange them not coming out...
He en't talking about the littlies, mun!
Anyway, the thing is is, to get inside Mam and see what's going on with the littlies, there's a little something you have to do first.
That's right!<NL>You've got to make me laugh, en't it?
Wh—<NL>What do you mean?
The only way into Mam's tummy is through her mouth, but it's so massive, she can't keep it open long unless she's laughing her head off.
So why don't you make her laugh, Mr. Drippy?
Don't be stupid, mun!<NL>I've been off the circuit for years!
I'm very particular, see? New material only!<NL>And his set is as old as the flipping hills...
So we can't help? Never mind. We didn't mean to come to this island anyway. We'll just leave it, shall we?
No, we shall not!<NL>Drippy, we have to do something!
Youer right. Proper worried about those littlies, I am... Let's go and look for someone who can make the old girl giggle, shall we?
But how?<NL>I don't know anything about comedy...
Well, there's a famous theater over by the Fairyground where us fairies cut ouer comic teeth.<NL>Called the <color:#1>Cavity Club</color>, it is.
And since I taught a couple of the boys down there everything they know, I reckon they'll be happy to help us in ouer hilarious mission!
You taught them?<NL>This I have to see!
All right!<NL>Let's go find the <color:#1>Cavity Club</color>!
Thanks, lovelies!<NL>Counting on you, I am!

eve0070_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hurry up, mun, they're on already!
Look at that!
They have a little stage and everything!
Take that...
Thank you, and goodnight.
Rubbish, they are these days, mun.
How long is this going to go on for?<NL>This is embarrassing.
Crikey... Another stinker...
Well, if it en't my old pals Smiley 'n' Surly!<NL>How do, boys?
Drippy!
How do, mun?<NL>Long time no see, eh?
Never mind the small talk, you pair of layabouts! What are you doing back by here? I sent you to spy on flipping Shadar, didn't I?
Ah, well, you see, we, umm...we just popped back home to get some cash to continue funding ouer, er...espionage, en't it, though?
We've been working ouer socks off, mun!<NL>Got a tidy bit of info just the other day, we did!<NL>See, what it is is, Shadar, see, well, he's...
...He's what, mun?<NL>Spit it out!
He's got all horns on his head, en't it!
Well, I know that, don't I?<NL>I've seen him in the flipping flesh!
So the news you were getting while you were a doll,<NL>Mr. Drippy, it was from...
That's right, Ollie-boy! Smiley 'n' Surly here were my eyes and ears on the ground!
Training up some new talent, are you?<NL>How do? I'm Smiley from Smiley 'n' Surly.
They look a bit wet, mun. And this one by here looks like he'd pinch the dummy from a baby's mouth!
Wh—<NL>You cheeky little—!
Don't take it personal, mun! It's just his way—it's why they call him Surly, en't it?
Hmph. It's better than grinning youer face off all day like this gormless idiot by here. Anyway, nice to meet you and all that.
Um, nice to meet you, too. Are these the fairies you said you trained, Drippy?
Can we get them to help us make your mum laugh?
Oh yeah! It's the least you can do after letting me down in youer spying duties! You've heard Mam's all clogged up with littlies, en't it?
Is it?<NL>There's serious!
We've not heard that, mun!
Hang on a minute— You two—<NL>Now I get it...
What is it, Mr. Drippy?
Well, it's like this, see...
We've been here all this time, and neither one of these two has cracked a single joke. It's worse than I thought, mun. They're...
They're <color:#1>broken-arted</color>!
Huh?
What?
Ahh, so that's it, is it, mun?<NL>I was wondering what was up with us, like...
Trust you to spot it, Drippy-boy.<NL>Proper sharp-eyed, you are!
Hold on a second! Does anyone have a clue what these lunatics are on about?
Oh yeah. Well, it's like this, see—we fairies' hearts are made up of all the different types of comedy.<NL><color:#1>Pieces of art</color>, we call them.
You mean like the pieces of heart that human hearts are made up of?
Weeell...it's not really the same, but if it helps you to think of it like that, fair enough. Anyway, when we lose a "piece of art," we become "<color:#1>artbroken</color>," see?
Just like when humans become heartbroken, you mean?
Nah, mun! What are you on about!?<NL>Completely different, it is!
Well, it doesn't sound it!
Heartbroken people just act all weird. Folks who get artbroken have it much worse—they stop being funny!<NL>I know! Terrible, en't it?
Umm...<NL>I don't think I quite understand...
I get it. This means we're in trouble, right?<NL>Because we need to make your mum laugh.
Make Mam laugh? Youer kidding, en't you? We couldn't make Laughy Laughingson laugh after a barrel of laughing gas, mun! Sorry. No can do.
He's right, mun. We tried giving him a second barrel but he sicked up, didn't he? Sad, really—we thought he was giggling at first.
Flipping useless you are, the pair of you!<NL>Still, you are <color:#1>artbroken</color>, I s'pose... All right. We'll help you.
You will? Tidy! A proper legend, you are, Drippy-boy!<NL>If we don't get funny soon, we'll have to split up.<NL>Imagine—after seventeen years!
Eh? Split up?<NL>That's the first I've flipping heard about it!
You're right, Drippy—we should help them!<NL>Just like you and Oliver helped me!
Tidy! That's that decided, then! Let's get all the<NL><color:#1>pieces of art</color> together and give these boys a laugh injection, shall we?
Nice one, Drippy-boy!<NL>You don't want to see us split up, eh?
What do you keep going on about splitting up for, mun? We've never said nothing about it!
Righto, Ollie-boy! Get youer <color:#1>piece-of-art</color>-gathering hat on! I reckon <color:#1>eight</color> should do it! Sound about right to you?
Come on, let's do it!<NL>We can't let them split up!
How many times, mun!<NL>We're not flipping splitting up!

eve0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
How do, boys? We got them <color:#1>pieces of art</color> for you, en't it?
Nice one, Drippy-boy!<NL>Youer a proper legend, mun!
Youer serious about this, is it? Making Mam laugh, I mean. Flipping heck, mun! Talk about in at the flipping<NL>deep end!
Ah, stop fretting, mun. You'll be fine! Righto, boys! Get ready for a dose of just what the doctor ordered!
...Abracagagraaa!!!
Flip, mun...
Wh-What's all this then, eh?<NL>I feel weird as heck, mun...
En't it, though? I feel like...I've woken up after a proper long sleep or something... I feel...better, mun!
Amazing! ...I think.<NL>They don't seem that different...
Oh, we're different all right! The comic muse is in the house! And we're about to bring it down around her flipping ears, mun!
This'll be a laugh...
I know! Amazing, en't it? That's the power of the<NL><color:#1>pieces of art</color>, mun! Proper miraculous, they are!
I could make a brick wall laugh, I feel so flipping funny, mun! Let's flipping do this! Show me the mummy!
Hold up, hold up! We need to practice first, en't it, though? Never mind jumping the gun, mun—youer flipping flying over the thing!
Uh, okay. You should practice.<NL>We'll come back when you're ready.

Ta! Ta!<NL>Ta very much!
Aww, he's so sweet!
Oi, littlie!<NL>What happened by here anyway?
Nasty! Nasty!<NL>Proper nasty!
What's that? ...No! Never!<NL>Well I'll be a monkey's uncle...
There's terrible!<NL>The Faycare Center has been invaded!
Horrible beasties have turned up, and they've been bullying all the littlies, the rotters!
That's awful!<NL>We have to help them!
Please, mun! Please, mun!<NL>Pleasepleaseplease!
'Course we'll help them. Goes without saying, en't it?<NL>I'm just wondering how come beasties got in here in the<NL>first place...
...Could he have made it all the way to the Fairyground? Shadar?
It's possible, I s'pose, yeah...<NL>But if he's made it past Mam...
Judging by what we saw him do in that storm,<NL>I don't think getting past your mum would be much<NL>of a challenge.
It doesn't matter how they got in.<NL>What matters right now is saving the littlies!
Youer right, Esther!<NL>Oi, you! Stay by here where it's safe, right?
Nah, mun! Wait, mun!<NL>Nahnahnah! Waitwaitwait!
Didn't you hear him?<NL>Stay here, he said!
But look at him! We can't just leave him here—he's terrified! We have to take him with us!
But we're off bashing beasties, en't it?<NL>It's not safe, mun! It's safe by here!
Scary! Scary! Proper scary!<NL>Aaaaaaaaahhh!
Don't be scared!<NL>You'll be fine!
I guess it's kinda dangerous to leave him here, too, huh, Mr. Drippy?
...Flipping heck, mun. All right.<NL>Come on then, you! We'll look after you!
Yes! Come along now, littlie!
Tidy! Let's go! Tidy! Tidy!<NL>Gogogoch!

eve0140_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
All here! All here!<NL>Tidy! Tidytidytidy!
That's some proper good work, you lot.<NL>Looks like all the littlies are safe and sound!
Are you sure? Thank goodness for that!
Let's have a quick count-up...<NL>One, two, three, four, five, all the littlies are alive!<NL>Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, never let them go again!
There's eleven, there's a dozen!<NL>Hey, that's Bevan, he's my cousin!<NL>How do, mun? Wahey, the gang's all here! Tidy!
Blimey, rhymy! Tidy! Tidy!<NL>Drippy! Drippy!
Gah, do they ever shut up!? They're so annoying!<NL>How do we get rid of them?
We take them to the exit, en't it? There's a slide outside—you go down that, and the way out's just by the<NL>bottom there!
A slide? Why is there a slide?
It's to remind them that they can slip and slide on the banana skins of life in here, but when they get outside,<NL>the same stuff won't slide, en't it?
Typical Mam, that is.<NL>She's a big fan of the old tough love...
I have literally no idea what you're talking about.<NL>Are you fairies all completely mad?
Hee hee! I don't care what he means!<NL>I'm just looking forward to the slide!
Oh, to be young and simple...<NL>And flexible. This sounds like it's going to hurt.
Not long now until the littlies are finally born!<NL>Let's take them to the exit!

eve0150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Righto!
Come on, littlies!
It's time for the slidy ride of youer tiny tidy lives!
Slidy tidy ridy! Tidy slidy! Slidy! Tidy!<NL>Wheeeeee!
(ガヤです)
Well? Don't just stand there!
Come on!
Huh!?
Aaaaaaaaah!!!
Hm?
What the—!?
What is that thing?
Knickers!
That rotter of a squid's got ouer kids!
What the heck!?
Knickers! Knickers!
Knickers! Knickers! Knickers!
The littlies!
No way!
We already saved them once!
Sorry, Ollie-boy, but the future of the fairy race is at stake!
<KEEP>
Do we have any choice?

eve0160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ta, mun! Ta! Ta!<NL>Tatatatatata!
Thank goodness!<NL>Is everyone all right?
Ha! 'Course they are! These littlies are nowhere near as fragile as they're egg-looking!
When I was their age, I ate squid for breakfast!<NL>Proper hard, I was!
...But wasn't that a jellyfish just now?
What a lucky escape, though!<NL>I've never seen a sea creature so big!<NL>I thought we were finished...
Well, something had to be done about it, and I s'pose we were just the ones to do it, eh? There's heroic of us!
Sure, someone had to make sure the littlies made it out somehow, huh?
Speaking of which, how do we get out of here?
Yes. How do we get out of here?
Th-There's no way out!<NL>We can't get back up the slide!
Of course we can't—it's miles back up to the top.<NL>So what do we do?
What do you think we do, mun?<NL>We get reborn, en't it?
Huh!?
What!?
Yeah, we pop out along with the littlies!<NL>Come on, mun—you only live once!
And you're only supposed to be born once, too, you demented little gnome! Just what are you suggesting!?
You flipping humans are so prudish! It's like this, see—just up beyond here is Mam's...exit. It's where the littlies get born from, en't it?
And if we just pop out with them, we'll be back in the Fairyground before you know it! Besides, it's not like we've got much choice in the matter...
"Just pop out"!?<NL>Are you mad!?
Poppy toppy! Tidy ridy!<NL>Wahey!
Gee...I don't know about this...
Don't worry. As long as we're together, we'll make it through somehow. Remember the Eye of the Storm?<NL>We survived that, didn't we?
Toppy poppy!<NL>Toppy poppy!
Then I guess this is it.<NL>Time to be born again...
Here goes nothing, mun!<NL>We'll make a quick exit...
And one heck of an entrance!!!

Where's Drippy?<NL>It's getting late...
Yeah, he must be knackered after the day we've had.<NL>I know I am... Oh, look. There he is.
You boys did a proper tidy job, mun!<NL>Mam was laughing fit to flipping burst!
Well, we couldn't have done it without you, Drippy-boy!
Them pieces of art pack a real punch, en't it though?<NL>We were on fire, mun!
Yeah, I s'pose you would've bombed without my help, eh? Mind you, youer routine... I've got to say, mun...
...it was pretty flipping funny.
Really? Thanks, Drippy-boy!
Took me back, it did. Back to the days when the stage was still my life... Ahh, it's a tidy while ago now...
Youer gags are legendary, mun! Classics, they were! Ouer material's nothing compared to youers. I'm just chuffed we made you chuckle!
He's right, mun. When it comes to tickling Mam's funny bone, there's no one ever did it quite like you,<NL>Drippy-boy!
Stop it, mun. Youer making me blush. The time for my jokes is long gone. I won't be back on the circuit<NL>anytime soon.
Besides, I've got that lot to be shepherding around now, en't it? What would they do without me?
Drippy-boy...
But I do think about it sometimes...
What would have happened, you know.<NL>If I'd never gone off with Alicia, like...
I wonder how far I would have gone in the old<NL>comedy game...
...
Mr. Drippy...
Oh, it's you lot, is it? What's up?<NL>You didn't hear all that, did you?
Uh, we...um... No.<NL>We didn't hear anything.
N-No, we just got here, didn't we? Um, anyway...it's late.<NL>We should get some rest.
Yeah...youer right. Tidy. I'll show you to the old inn, shall I? It's a bit small for you lot, but you'll just have to grin and bear it!
How am I supposed to sleep in a fairy-sized bed?
I'm sure you'll manage somehow. You never seem to have much trouble falling into a deep and noisy sleep...

You're a...a fairy?
I am, and a proper tidy one at that!
You talk funny...
That's how fairies talk, sweetie.
But it's goofy...
Oh, is it now?
Well I wish I'd known that before I made him for you.
Nobody made him.
He's my friend.
Of course he is. I'm sorry.<NL>And I'm sure he'll always be your friend, no matter what.
Come on now, don't be such a Cry-Baby Bunting.<NL>What would Mr. Drippy think?
I'm not a Cry-Baby Bunting!
Then you'd better dry those tears, hadn't you?
Hm?

Oh, how can I ever thank you, bach?<NL>Saved my life, you did!
We're just happy to help, Ma'am.<NL>And we're sure glad the littlies are safe.
But are you all right now? You did have a giant jellyfish inside you, after all.
Ohh, is that what it was? I thought it was a squid!<NL>Us fairies love a bit of seafood, see, and it looked so big and juicy, I just couldn't help myself...
You mean...?
That's right, bach!<NL>Swallowed it straight down, I did!
What!? There we were worrying she'd been attacked by Shadar, and it was all because she's too greedy for her own good?
Look on the bright side, Swaine—it means the reason was much less serious than we thought it was.
Shadar, you say? Where've I heard that name before?<NL>Shadar... Shadar...
Oh, hiiim!
You know Shadar, Ma'am?
Nope!
Is she taking the mick?
Sorry, love! Of course I know him! He's that one who was flying around my head, causing all kinds of mischief! Proper little terror, he is!
Smileeey!<NL>Surlyyy!<NL>Get youer bottoms over by here!
We're here, we're here.<NL>Keep youer hair on, mun...
What is it, Mam?<NL>Stop flipping shouting!
Can you two boys go and take a look over by Shadar's castle for me?
Wh—!?<NL>Knickerrrs!!!
Not bad, love, not bad. I thought you'd lost youer comic touch, but what a reaction! Found youer form again, you have. There's lovely!
This en't part of ouer flipping act, mun! You just asked us to go to Shadar's flipping castle! What kind of reaction did you expect?
We can't refuse Mam, though, can we?<NL>We'd best go and have a look, eh?
Crikey, you don't take much convincing do you?
Yeah, mun, but think about Ollie-boy and that.<NL>They helped us out good and proper, en't it, though?<NL>Least we can do is return the favor.
There you go being noble again.<NL>What did I tell you about that?
Please, boooys! For meee? You wouldn't want to disappoint youer dear old mam now, would you?
You can say that again. We know better than to get on youer bad side. Looks like we're taking a sabbatical<NL>then, eh?
What's that? Splitting up, you mean?<NL>Righto. Might as well, eh?
How many times!? We are not flipping splitting up!<NL>I meant we'll have to take a break for a bit! Honestly!
Thank you, Smiley!<NL>Thank you, Surly!
Don't thank us, thank Mam. It was her flipping idea.<NL>Ta, Mam. Anyway, we'll let Drippy-boy know if we find anything, en't it.
Thank you!<NL>Speaking of Drippy, where is he?
He's slipped off, en't it? Probably gone to say bye to all the boys in town, eh.
Mr. Drippy...
Righto! Youer off now, en't you, bach?
Me? Uh, yes, Ma'am!<NL>We have to find the next Great Sage.
'Course you do, love. Youer a wizard, en't it?<NL>Fancy a spell or two to be going on youer way with?
Uh, oh...yeah, I guess...<NL>I mean, yes please, Ma'am!
Wow! That's a lot of spells!
Ha! It sure is!<NL>Thank you so much, Ma'am!
And they're all proper useful ones, too! Well, useful to fairies, at least... Still, I'm sure there's one or two in there that you can make use of, love.
We'll have a look later. We need to get moving. Come on, we've wasted enough time. Let's find Lanternface and get back to the boat.
You're right. We need to get back on the trail of the<NL>Great Sage!

Maybe we should. This is where he belongs, after all.

Huh?
Mr. Drippy?
Oooooooooi!

Haa... Haa...<NL>Phew! I'm pooped, mun!
You trying to leave without me or something?
But...Drippy... We thought you wanted to stay back there in the Fairyground.
Who told you that, mun? And when, exactly?<NL>I want names, dates, times!
We just thought...all your friends are back there.
'Course they are, mun! And they're very dear to me—<NL>even the stupid ones!
But you and me have been a team now since you were a littlie and I was just a doll, en't it, Ollie-boy?
I've been by youer side through thick and thin!<NL>Remember what you said?
You said I was youer friend!
You lot are all my friends! My companions!<NL>My brothers and sisters! My family.
Eurgh. I'm going to be sick.
Shut it, you! What I mean is, you lot are stuck with me whether you like it or not, so get that into youer thick skulls, will you?
Yes, Sir, Mr. Drippy!
Hmph! We were only trying to be nice after we heard what you said to your friends yesterday!
Oh, so it's my fault now, is it?
I get it! You don't think I've been pulling my weight, is it? Fine! I'm going to start using a little trick I know that'll blow youer tiny minds!
Heh. I can't wait to see this. Anyway, it looks like the gang's all here. Shall we get back to what we're supposed to be doing?

The Eye of the Storm...
Until now, the use of this most ancient of magics was the sole privilege of the overseers of this world.
<KEEP>
Was it...too much for you, perhaps?
We granted you this privilege that you might finally dispose of the prophesied one.
My apologies, Your Radiance.
But the boy...
He has a...unique power.
Perhaps. Or perhaps you simply lack the power to stop him. Perhaps—
Apus.
Forgive me, Your Radiance.
Majesty, the boy is clearly protected by<NL>the most potent of magics.
Could it be...?
The sage? Alicia?
I had wondered, Your Radiance.
She who was foolish enough to stand against you?<NL>You think she troubles us even now, in the present?
The power that protects him would suggest so...
But he will need more than the sage's aid to save the world.
He cannot succeed without the weapon of the ancients,<NL>the wand wrought by the Wizard King...
Mornstar?
Indeed. But we have no cause to fear its power.
He will not find it.<NL>I have made that...impossible.
Making a wand disappear is the simplest of parlor tricks, after all.
You mean to say you have rid us of Mornstar?
I have. The most enduring symbol of the Wizard King's rule now drifts free of time and space.
Mornstar...
Fashioned in the image of our own Council's wands, and bestowed upon humanity.
Yet now, a mere hindrance...
You are certain the boy cannot possess it?
Not now...nor for all eternity...

He kinda looks like...a pig.
Jeepers! Take a look around!<NL>They're ALL dressed like pigs!

Right! You lot have fun looking around!<NL>I'm off!
Huh? Wait!<NL>...Swaaaine!
Geez...<NL>What's with him?
Why'd he just run off like that?

Huh?<NL>You mean...?
Yep. It's about the Great Sage you're all so eager to find.
Tidy! Well, come on, then! Where is he?<NL>Don't keep us in suspense, mun!
Ah, well, that's the thing.<NL>He's in the palace...
The palace?
You see how everyone here is forced to wear a pig mask? Well, they say there's this fellow who goes around<NL>without one.
Apparently, he calls himself the Prince's servant.
And there's more. They say he's a young chap with long hair and fine features...
Wait! That sounds like the boy in the picture we got from the Cowlipha!
Got it in one!
Goodness! And there I was thinking you were<NL>completely useless!
There's harsh!<NL>Doesn't mince her words, does she?
But how did you find out about this, Swaine?
Oh, it was just something I overheard while I was wandering through the Black Market...
The Black Market? You certainly seem to know your way around this city, Swaine...
Me? No, no. Never been here before in my life.<NL>I have a good nose for leads, is all...
You don't get a face like this unless you've lived a little. Let's just say I know a thing or two about a thing or two...
Hmph!
So he serves the Prince, huh? Then he must be real important. That parade was something else...
...Pah!
Now, talking about that porky prince fellow,<NL>the thing is is—
Flipping heck! What's all that racket!?<NL>I almost jumped out of my fairy suit, mun!
What's going on?
The Ministry of Conduct announces a new emergency decree from the Prince!
Let it hereby be known that article 2904 of the constitution forbids passersby from making eye contact.
Anyone violating this law will be liable for a fine of five thousand guilders or three years' imprisonment.
All hail the Prince!
Flipping eye contact!?<NL>What kind of law is that!?
I've never heard anything like it!<NL>Just what is going on here?
This is insane!<NL>How could he...?
Oi! You want to find the Great Sage, don't you?<NL>Well, hurry up and head to the palace!
You're right! Let's go!

You lot are travelers, I take it?
That's right, Sir! We've come to Hamelin to meet one of the Great Sages! And we think he's inside the palace!
Is that so? And I suppose you'd like me to let you in so you can have a look for him, am I right? ...Ha! A Great Sage, indeed! Good one, boy!
Huh?
You've obviously not been listening to your emergency decrees. No one's been allowed anywhere near the palace for ages.
Ha ha ha! These travelers, eh?<NL>Never seem to have a clue, do they?
Uh, excuse me!?<NL>At least we have some manners—
I do apologize for my young friend. She was merely unaware of the decree you mentioned, and is regrettably quick to anger. We beg your pardon...
S-Swaine! What on earth are you—
Shhh! I've got an idea...
An idea...?
What is it, then? Got a way to get us into the palace,<NL>have you?
Yes, and it's very simple. We wear disguises.
Disguises!?
Keep youer voice down, mun!
Haven't you noticed? The guards' faces can't be seen under that armor they're wearing...
What!? You're saying we're going to have to wear those awful pig suits!?
But where would we get them, Swaine?
We're not going to have to steal it, are we!?
Pipe down, mun! Seriously!
All right, everybody just stay calm. I told you about the <color:#1>Black Market</color> they have here in Hamelin, right?
Well, they'll definitely have some pig armor for us there. We just have to go and get it.

I need some grunt armor. Four suits. Can you help me out?
Blimey! G-Grunt armor!?<NL>I don't handle gear like that, Sir!<NL>...But if I did, what would you need it for?
You don't need to worry about that. Let's just say...the place we need to go has what you might call a strict dress code...
Is that a fact? Well...even if I was in the armor business, gear like that ain't easy to get hold of... You'll just have to look elsewhere, Sir.
I see. Well, I had hoped that I wouldn't have to<NL>mention this...
But I know about Grace. I know you love her, and that you try to hide her—
Don't say another word!<NL>Where did you hear that name?
Heh... You know how it goes. Spend long enough in the gutter and you're bound to pick up some dirt...
...All right! I'll get you your armor!
I'll get it for you right away! Just wait a moment...
Huh? Did you...? Was that a threat!?
...Maybe. But the end justifies the means, right?<NL>We need that armor—
That's terrible! This isn't right, we can't take advantage of people like this—
Yes, yes, all right! I did a terrible thing.<NL>You're right! I'm sorry!
There, I apologized. Stop looking at me like that.<NL>It won't happen again, all right?

Well... I promise to try my best...
Hmph! You can't even make a simple promise?<NL>What kind of a man are you!?
Here's your armor! Sorry to keep you waiting!<NL>Are you gonna put it on straightaway?
Yeah, if you don't mind. Thanks...
Thank you, Mr. Abel!
Now look, I don't know what you're up to, but be careful, all right?
Oh, and...nice one, by the way.
What...?
Your friend—I take my hat off to him.<NL>Only a real pro could've worked out my little secret.
Funny, really—before he mentioned it, I had him down as a right joker. But he obviously knows what he's doing, eh!? Heh heh!
So...it wasn't a threat?
Swaine, look...
Come on. Let's get changed.

Look, Swaine, I'm sorry about what I said before... I just—
It's fine. Now, how does your armor feel?
Uh... I guess mine's a little big...
Mine too. I bet I look huge...
No no...<NL>You look just like you usually do.
Hm!? What is that supposed to mean!?
Come on you guys, let's stop fighting and head for<NL>the palace!
You're right, Oliver!<NL>Let's find that Great Sage!

Ohh, you went to pick up the Prince's weekly supply, did you? He never gets tired of those things. All right for some, eh? You ever tried one?
(Oh my goodness...! Just say "no," Swaine!)
Yes, Sir. Just the once, Sir.<NL>Black truffles are a bit on the expensive side, Sir!
You're not wrong there! You'd need to be a prince to afford that habit! Well then, you'd better hurry and deliver them. In you go!
(Neato! We're in!)

You really know your stuff, Swaine!<NL>Did you use to work here or something?
Heh heh. No, nothing like that.<NL>Why are you so interested in my past, anyway?
I'm not the least bit interested in your past!<NL>I'm just making conversation!
Crikey... That told him!
Now listen, we've done well to get this far, but if the guards find us now, we'll be in big trouble.
Don't do youerself down, mun! From what I've just seen, you can sweet-talk us past anyone!
I don't think my silver tongue's going to get us any further. From here on in, they'll attack first, and ask questions later.
What!? So we just give up, do we!?
No! We can't give up! We've made it this far. We have to keep going! Let's just make sure we don't get caught!
All right, Oliver, but listen: if a guard spots you, just start running as fast as you can!
Hmm. It en't much of a plan, but it'll do for me!

Wait. If we go through here, I think we'll come out somewhere around...there. Well, it's worth a try, isn't it?
It certainly is!

evf0155_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
All right, in we go...
Uh... This armor's too big to fit inside...
Well then, let's take it off!
Take it off!? You don't take off youer disguise at a time like this, mun! I'm keeping mine on. Size en't a problem for me!
Disguise? Drippy, you're just wearing a helmet...
Too right I am! And I'm the only one of us that's got half a chance of not getting caught. I'll tell you why, shall I?
Don't tell me—you've learned to do a Hamelin accent!
No, you sarky so-and-so, it's because this helmet by here is the best disguise of all!
Every time I hear a guard coming, I just tuck in my arms and legs, en't it?
The guards just see a helmet lying on the ground, and continue on their merry way. Blending in with the environment, en't it? Tidy!
Blending in...?
Like ulk. They blend into their environment, too...
No, mun! That's completely different!
Uh...sure. So anyway, it looks like this manhole is our only option, huh?
Unless Drippy can find us some giant helmets to wear, yes. Let's get down there, shall we?

evf0160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look at this place...
It's amazing...
Yeah...
It sure is something.
So this is how the other half live, is it?
Proper swanky, this is!
Oi!
It's this way!
Hm?
Come on, get a move on!
Okay!
Are you sure about this...?
What now!?
Run! Run, I tell you!
Swaaaine!!!
Never a minute's rest with you lot, is there!?

evf0170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
(pant) Flipping heck, mun! I can't take much more of this!
I don't think we have much choice—listen!
Dammit! The guards must have heard us fighting.<NL>They'll be here any minute...
You're right! I can hear voices!<NL>Come on, we have to run!
Don't worry about me, Ollie-boy! First sign of trouble, and I'll turn into a carelessly mislaid helmet, en't it!?

evf0190_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
They went that way!
Don't let 'em get away!
This way! After 'em!
Oi! Wait for me!
Ugh! So...so...hideous...
Why am I so...
...ugly!?
S-Someone's coming...
Must...hurry!
Wh-Who are you?
But you must be...
You're the Prince!
C-Correct.
I am Prince Marcassin, ruler of Hamelin.
And who might you be?
「いえ…」「その…」
What do you think you're doing here?
Hm? ...Oh! Nooo!
I can't— You mustn't—
Gah! No!
Get away! Do not look at me!<NL>Get out of here, I say! You mustn't look at me!
<KEEP>
Go! Begone!

evf0200_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Wow!
So the Prince is the Great Sage?
Got it in one.
Just who in the world are you?
Your Highness...
You have nothing to fear.
There's something we'd like to ask you.
Something to ask me?
...Ah, I see.<NL>Now you know my secret, you mean to blackmail me!
<KEEP>
That's not it!
We came to... We wanted...
We need the Great Sage's help!
Huh?
Great Sage...?
You mean me?
Yes, of course we do.
You were one of the Great Sages who protected this world. Weren't you?
I am sorry to disappoint you.
It was my father who was the Great Sage.
He passed away fifteen years ago.
But you inherited his powers, didn't you?
The Great Sage's powers?
Hmph.
You should not believe everything you hear.
I was never good enough.
How could I be a Great Sage?
Me of all people?
...I have no gift for magic.
But you...
I think you've been here long enough.
No one asked you to come.
Now leave me alone!
Go!
There's something iffy about that lad, I reckon.
Do you think...?
No doubt. He's brokenhearted.
But which piece of his heart is missing?
What that boy's lost is his belief, like.
Sure as eggs is eggs.
His belief?
That's right.
Folks can tell him how blinking handsome he is till they're blue in the face...
...but will he believe them?
Not a bit of it!
Lost his belief, he has—in himself and everyone else.
And he calls himself a prince?
That's a laugh!
He's just a sniveling little wimp.
Come on!<NL>Let's go find that piece of heart!
Right!
He's more trouble than he's worth.
I guess we'll be going then, Your Highness.
I know that man...but from where?

evf0210_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So the Great Sage is the Prince himself, is it?
And he's brokenhearted!
We have to do something, and fast!<NL>We need to find him some <color:#1>belief</color>...
Er...is it just me or is it getting misty in here?
Whoa... This is really something...
What's going on now, all of a sudden?
I can't see a thing...
Huh? Wait a second...
Hm?
There's someone there...
Wh-Who? I can't see anything...
Huh!?
Where'd they come from?
They're still after us!
Huh?
Aaah!
To our right! Look!
There's more behind us!
<KEEP>
Dammit!
We're surrounded.
Huh!
Just who in blazes do you think you are?
And where in the world did you spring from?
I will have answers!
Huh? We could ask you the same thing!
Mind your tongue, girl!
You stand before an emperor!
We'll take care of them, Your Majesty.
Emperor!?
(gasp)
Stand down!
I must discover how they came to appear here.<NL>And I shall not rest until I have done so.
It is my sworn duty to know all that goes on in my domain.
Come!
Bring them to my chamber!<NL>We have much to discuss.
Sir!
Aaah!

evf0220_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...Ha ha ha ha ha!
The more I listen to your lies, the more laughable<NL>they become!
Are you truly trying to suggest that you are from...<NL>the future?
...Is it really true, Swaine?<NL>I'm not sure I believe it myself...
There's no doubt about it.<NL>You saw the sorry state of the Prince with your own eyes.
The man you see before you now, on the other hand...<NL>He's the former Emperor of Hamelin!
Hm. You shall tell more of this.
Now, speak! What becomes of Hamelin in the future?<NL>And who is this "Prince" that you encountered?
Uh... He had long, dark hair and...blue eyes...
Hmm... Ha ha ha ha ha!
If you must tell lies, you might at least make them credible, boy!
Huh? We're not lying, he—
Do you mean to tell me that my younger son will one day become emperor!?
Y-Younger...?
So that mardy prince has got an older brother, has he?
Look at this.
This is your darling son Marcassin, all grown up.<NL>This is the future Emperor of Hamelin.
Hmm... It does indeed look somewhat similar to my son...
...Should you really be showing him that, Swaine?
I had to do something.<NL>He never would've believed us otherwise.
Marcassin becomes emperor...<NL>But what of Gascon? What will become of him?
Well... You never really liked him much anyway, did you?<NL>He wasn't really emperor material...
...Are you claiming that I do not care for my own son?<NL>I have had men imprisoned for less!
Are you denying it? Surely not.<NL>Marcassin was the only son you ever wanted.
H-How dare you! How dare you make such a claim!
Your Majesty! Something terrible has occurred!
It's Prince Gascon and Prince Marcassin! They went out to practice their magic, but...they have ventured beyond the city walls!
Leave them be! They shall fend for themselves.
B-But Your Majesty—think of the danger...<NL>And Prince Marcassin is still so young...
Y-You're not going to go help them, Your Majesty!?
Certainly not. They must learn to resolve problems that are of their own making. That is the Hamelin way.
Y-You're really just going to abandon your own children?
Silence!
But they're in danger, Your Majesty!<NL>If you won't help them, we will!
Look, we don't have time for a staring contest. I say we leave this old fool to stew, and find those kids.
What did you say!?
We'll continue this later, shall we?

evf0230_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look! There! It's them!
Come on! Now!
Here goes... Aaargh!
I just can't do it...
Stop whining! Try again!
Be careful, Gascon!
Huh!?<NL>Aaaaaargh!
Aaaaaah!
Marcassin!
Gascon!
We've got to help them!
Yes!

evf0240_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Phew... Crikey, that was a close one!
Are you all right? You two are princes, aren't you?<NL>Your father is the Emperor.
...Yes! My name is Marcassin.
Shut up, you fool! We can't go telling everybody<NL>who we are!
...Oh? So your brother isn't going to tell us his name?
Leave me alone!
Leave you alone!?
You do realize that we're the ones who came and rescued you after you went off all on your own, don't you!?
Heh! No one asked you to!
We were practicing magic!<NL>Until you lot got in the way, that is...
Uhhh... G-Gascon... I'm...h-hungry...
What? Already?
Well... I suppose we'd better get you something to eat, then. Come on, you lot!
...Huh?
Heh... You'd never make it back to Hamelin by yourselves. We'd better escort you.
Escort....us?
Yeah. Don't worry, you can thank us later.

evf0250_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Are you lot still following us!?
B-But we've got to tell the Emperor that we've found you!
Heh... You want to see my father, do you?<NL>I wonder what you want from him...
...Actually, I don't care. Bye!
H-Hang on a minute, mun! We saved youer skin back then! En't you going to thank us or anything?
Thank you? You're the ones who should be thanking us for escorting you back to Hamelin!
The flipping cheek of this kid!<NL>I en't never seen anything like it, mun!
Kid!? I'm not a kid! And I have a name: Gascon. "Prince" Gascon to you. Be sure to address me properly if we ever meet again.
Now come along, Marcassin!
A-All right...
Wh-Who the blinking heck does he think he is!?<NL>He's got me proper wound up, he has!
So the two princes are called Gascon and Marcassin...
There's something about Prince Gascon...
Hmm? What is it?
I feel like I've met him somewhere before.<NL>I guess it's just my imagination, though...
Oh, definitely. No doubt about it, it's your imagination<NL>all right!
I, I guess so, huh...
Now, stop wasting time with harebrained theories.<NL>We need to get moving!

evf0260_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ha ha ha ha ha! I admire your spirit. Not every child would so readily refuse an emperor.
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.<NL>But there's something we have to do...
Indeed... And yet your magical abilities really are outstanding. I realize now that I should never have doubted you!
You understand that I am reluctant to let such a talent slip away. Are you sure I can't persuade you to be Marcassin's magic teacher?
...Heh. Just as stubborn as I remember.
Hm? What did you say?
I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but we really do have to go back to our own time.
It's just...we don't know how.
You wish to go back to your time? To the future? Well... Breach Time would be ideal, of course...
"Breach Time"?
A legendary spell, one that allows the caster to take a leap through time. Alas, it has long been sealed away on account of its power...
Gee...that sounds like just what we need. I wonder if there's a way we could get this <color:#8>Breach Time</color> spell...
Hey! I heard about your "new rule"!
Why can't I go with Marcassin and help him<NL>practice his magic!?
Really, Gascon—we both know you haven't a single magical bone in your body! Marcassin is to become a sage. He will learn nothing from the likes of you!
That's not true! I'll teach Marcassin magic!<NL>I'll help him become a sage, you'll see!
He does not need your help! Your time would be better spent thinking of another role for yourself within<NL>the Empire.
What kind of "role" are you talking about?
Would you have me spoon-feed everything to you!?<NL>You must find your own answers to such questions.<NL>That is the Hamelin way!
Fine! Come on, Marcassin.<NL>Let's go and practice some magic.
All right!
Hmm... I am sorry that you had to witness that.
...
You were talking about <color:#8>Breach Time</color>, Your Majesty...
Yes... Now, in return for rescuing my sons, I shall relate to you a piece of Hamelin lore.
It states that the spell required to travel through time is hidden on the <color:#1>Tombstone Trail</color>, along with the wand required to cast it...
T-Tombstone Trail...? I don't like the sound of that...
The Tombstone Trail winds its way through a desolate valley to the northwest of here. At its end stands an ancient altar, dating from the Age of Sages.
That is where you will find the legendary wand <color:#1>Mornstar</color>...
Mornstar!?
Prove yourself worthy of wielding that wand, and you shall surely be deemed ready to cast <color:#8>Breach Time</color>.
Be aware, however, that you can only cast <color:#8>Breach Time</color> once in your life.
If you go back to the future, you will not be able to return to this time. Do you understand?
Yes, Your Majesty. We understand. We're going to get Mornstar, and travel back to our own time!
Your enthusiasm is admirable! Yet beware: the <color:#1>Tombstone Trail</color> is home to countless evil spirits. Take this spell, and use it to keep the fiends at bay!
We sure will!<NL>Thank you, Your Majesty!

evf0330_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Here we are. The Tombstone Trail...
Hey!
...Huh?
Heh heh... Heading into the valley, are you?<NL>Well, we're coming with you!
What? You're not serious...
Flipping heck, mun! They must have followed us all the way here, the cheeky little beggars!
You've got a gun, haven't you? Well, I'm building my own special gun. Looks like we've got some things in common. Here—look and learn!
Dear me...were you always this cocky?
But we can't very well go leaving you to get lost in a place like this now, can we?
If anything happened, the Emperor would go<NL>flipping spare!
Heh. You don't honestly think my father would lose a moment's sleep if I disappeared, do you?
He doesn't give a damn about me!<NL>All he cares about is Marcassin!
G-Gascon, that's not—
Come on! Let's go!<NL>I'll go without you if I have to!
Wh-Why is he giving us orders all of a sudden?
Wow... I-I'm struggling to believe it myself.<NL>...What were you thinking?
Sorry? What was that, Swaine?
...Nothing. Come on, let's go.

evf0336_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ugh! Ughhhhhh...
...Hm?<NL>Mwahaha!
Mwahahahahahaha!<NL>Not a pulse among them!<NL>They're dead! DEAD!!!
C-C-Come here, quick!<NL>Fresh c-c-corpses, boys!<NL>The first in years!
Oliver! Oliver, wake up!
H-Hey... It looks like we made it.
Made it into another graveyard, at least...
So does this mean—
Wakey wak-k-k-key!<NL>Risen already, I see!
Wh-Whoa! What's that!?
Why, I'm your new friend! We're aaall friends now!<NL>Luck-ck-cky you! Mwahaha!
Th-Thanks...
Now, to c-c-commemorate the happy event of your death, allow me to present you with this k-k-k-k-k-key!
Here you are!
Wh-What's this—
I'm glad you asked! You see, here on the Tombstone Trail, we don't think-k-k-k that you have to stop having fun just because you're dead.
That's why we're c-c-currently in the process of building a magnificent c-c-<color:#1>casino</color>!
As soon as it opens, you c-c-can use that key to let yourself in and start enjoying the millionaire deathstyle.
A casino...?
That's right! A place where the discerning dead c-c-can go when they want to die a little. It'll take us a few<NL>dec-c-cades to build, but the wait will be worth it!
A few decades!?
Well, there's no rush, is there?<NL>We're all dead, after all! Muahaha!
I... I guess so! Thank you, Mister!
I've got to say, mun—for a corpse animated by arcane magicks from the dark beyond, that skeleton is<NL>proper friendly!

evf0350_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
All right, Marcassin! Do it, just like I told you!
O-Okay!
It's... It's no good.<NL>I'm sorry, Gascon. I just can't do it...
Marcassin! Are you...lying to me!?
Wh-What...?
I know you can do it!<NL>You're just pretending that you can't!
No! I-I'm not pretending!
You are! Why would you do something like that?
I'm not pretending! I'm really not!
Hey! You shouldn't pick on your little brother like that!
I wasn't picking on him!<NL>I just want to know the truth!
Well there's no need to be so pushy!<NL>I'm sure he'll be able to cast that spell before long!
Don't you see!? He can already cast that spell!<NL>He can cast loads of spells!
Huh...?
He's always been able to. And now all of a sudden he's pretending that he can't. Why would he do that?
Maybe he enjoys watching Father tell me off...
...Do you really think that's it, Gascon?
Eh?
Marcassin hates seeing you get told off.<NL>But he'd hate being separated from you even more.
What are you...?
Only those who are capable of becoming sages can ascend to the throne of Hamelin. Isn't that right?
How can you...? What are you saying that for!?
Because Marcassin knows it, too.
He knows that if he were to show promise as a sage...<NL>If he showed himself worthy of being emperor...
Well, I don't need to tell you what would happen.
That's why he keeps pretending to be no good at magic...
What are you...?<NL>How do you know all this?
Heh. I don't know what to tell you...<NL>All I can say is that this isn't a situation I'd wish on anyone.
It doesn't matter! I want Marcassin to become a powerful wizard!
I won't let you stop me helping that happen, no matter who you are!
(sigh) I know you won't.<NL>Hell, I wouldn't...

evf0370_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Huh!
Aaaaaah!
Aaah! What's going on!?
Aaaaaah! What's going on!?
Aaaaaargh!
That flipping great candle must be guarding Mornstar!
<KEEP>
Well then, I guess we're going to have to prove we've got what it takes to get it!
Everybody ready?

evf0380_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Crikey! Back for more, is it?
It doesn't know when to give up!
Grrraaarrrgh!
Aaargh! Aaaaaah!
Look out!
Huh?
Hm? Huh?
Marcassin!
Yah!
Haa...
Marcassin... That spell... Did you...?
Yes.
You did it, Marcassin! You got him!<NL>That was amazing!
Thanks, Gascon...
Marcassin, you saved us! Thank you!
Oh, it was nothing...<NL>Now hurry, let's get <color:#1>Mornstar</color>!
He's right, you know! Come on, Ollie-boy!<NL>Let's head for that altar, en't it!

evf0390_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
The legendary wand must be in here...
<KEEP>
Huh!
Look at that! What a beauty!
It may be older than my mam,<NL>but it's still got a bucketload of oomph!
So this is the legendary wand—
Mornstar...
Aaargh!
You have done well.
Who are you?
Huh!?
(gasp)
I am one who guides the fate of this world. And yes, it was I who summoned you here to this time.
...Huh!?
ん…　お、おぉ！
I had scant choice but to bring you here, for in your time, Mornstar has been...mislaid.
For my boldness, you must accept my apologies.
Know that countless trials lie ahead of you still.
Steel yourselves and fix your sights upon your goal.
Until the day when you finally arrive...
...I shall be waiting.
Huh?
He's gone...

evf0400_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
<color:#8>Breach Time</color>, eh...? I suppose the rumors about you lot coming from the future are true, then...
I've never seen any masked wizards here in Hamelin before, though. Have you, Marcassin?
No, never...
Well, let's head back to Hamelin for now, Oliver.<NL>We need to take the princes back to their father.
...Yeah.
...Are you okay, Gascon?

evf0410_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I'm sorry everyone, but this I where I say good-bye.
It's time we went our separate ways.
Huh...?
What are you talking about? Aren't you coming back to Hamelin with us?
...No. I'm not going back.
I've got my own journey to go on!
Your own journey?<NL>You mean you're running away from home?
Hey... Look after yourself, all right?<NL>Here, you'd better take this.
...
Father gave me that sword...<NL>But you're the one who should have it.
It's the kind of sword that a sage should wield.<NL>A sage like you'll be someday.
Hey, don't cry!
You don't need to be scared! If you ever get in trouble,<NL>I'll come and help you, I promise!
Wherever you are, no matter how far away, I'll always be there for you if you need me!
Wherever...I am...?
Yes, I promise you! But if I'm going to live up to this promise, I'm going to have to do some training of my own.
As Father keeps saying, I need to find my own role within the Empire. I need to find out what I'm good at...
I won't let him down. I refuse to be a disappointment...
All right. But please come back soon...
I'll be waiting for you...
You do that, Marcassin!<NL>We'll meet again one day, you'll see!
I wish you and your friends all the best as well, Oliver.<NL>I hope you make it back to your time!
Thanks, Prince Gascon!<NL>I sure hope we meet again someday!
Heh! I don't think you have to call me "Prince" anymore. Well, good-bye!
H-Hey! Wait!
...What is it?
Are you really sure about this, Gascon?
...It's what I've decided.
I'll be better off watching Marcassin from afar.<NL>Watching him become a sage...
I don't change my mind once I've made a decision.
That's the Gascon way.
..."The Gascon way."
Well, it sounds like you're determined to be<NL>your own man...
But I refuse to say good-bye.
Let's just say...until next time!
Heh, all right! Until next time!
In the future...
In your time... See you then!
Take care, Gascon!
Gosh, that boy really is stubborn...
Now, come on, Oliver!<NL>Let's head back to our time!
Sure thing!

evf0420_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oh! The Emperor!
<KEEP>
Your Majesty!
(gasp)
Huh!
Father!
But why?
What happened!?
Sha... Shadar...
Shadar?
Yes... He was here... He came to...<NL>To demand our unconditional...surrender.
Huh!?
B-But let it be known...
I defied him...<NL>I would not bow to that wretch...
Ugh...
No, don't...
Don't try to speak...
Gascon.
Huh?
My son...
My beloved son...
You really thought I couldn't tell?
You knew...?
Your appearance may have changed...<NL>but I know my own flesh and blood.
What the future holds is a mystery to all men...
But I know... I know that together...you and Marcassin can...
I believe in you... Protect the Empire...<NL>Now...and in the future...
Father! No!
Please!
I got to meet you again...and now this?<NL>I just wanted... I just wanted to make you proud.
And now...this has to happen!<NL>Dammit!
Swaine...
…っ！！
あっ… ああぁっ！
Nooooooooo!!!

evf0430_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Several days later...
I wonder what's taking Swaine so long...
I just can't believe that he's Gascon. The heir to all of Hamelin... My mind's boggled beyond all belief, mun!
I guess he didn't want us to know, huh...
...I suppose so.
It won't be the same now we know that he's a prince...
Well, I'm going to act like I don't know!
Me too! Unless Swaine wants to talk about it,<NL>I'm not going to say a word!
...Hm? Ohh, you don't need to worry about me, mun!<NL>I'll have forgotten all about this in a bit.<NL>Couldn't remember it if I wanted to, me!
If there's one thing I'm good at, it's forgetting!
Sorry to keep you waiting...
Swaine!
I suppose it's time to go.<NL>But I need to say good-bye to Marcassin first.
All right...

evf0440_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It's today that you're leaving, isn't it...?
Yes, Your Highness.
Thank you for everything...
No, no, I should be thanking you.
Because of you, I was able to become my father's heir,<NL>and soon I'll formally inherit his title...
Yeah, I bet the people of Hamelin are glad about that,<NL>and all!
I mean to give them a reason to be. I want them to know that they have nothing to fear from Shadar. I refuse to let him defeat us!
I want Gascon to be able to come back to Hamelin whenever he likes, after all.
I must keep the Empire safe until he does so!
...You'll make a fine emperor, Marcassin.<NL>Gascon would be proud of you.
I hope so! He always believed in me...<NL>And I shall never stop believing that he will come back...
Look at youer Locket, Ollie-boy! It's all aglow, mun!<NL>You don't think—
It must be! Marcassin's <color:#1>belief</color> in his brother must be real strong!
I'm sorry, I—
Your Highness, there's someone who needs your help!<NL>Someone who needs some of the strength that's in<NL>your heart...
My heart...? Whoever are you talking about?
Well...you, Your Highness. I-In the future, I mean.<NL>In our time, a piece of your heart is...missing...
My future self...?
That's right. And we need you to share some of your <color:#1>belief</color> with him, to help him get back to normal!
My <color:#1>belief</color>...
...Very well! I can hardly refuse my own future self a piece of my heart!

evf0450_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Thank you very much, Your Highness!
There is no need to thank me. Now, please, give that <color:#1>belief</color> to my future self!
But before you go...
Swaine...?
...Yes?
When you return to your time, please give my regards to my future brother.
...
...I'll be sure to do that, Your Highness.
Righto, back to the future it is! You know which spell you want, don't you, Ollie-boy? <color:#8>Breach Time</color>, en't it!?
Roger! Let's go, everybody! To the future!

evf0460_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Okay! All together!
Today, tomorrow, yesterday!<NL>Send us safely on our way!

Oliver's gone...
They've all gone...
...Did we make it?
Huh? Aren't we still in the same place...?
No way, mun. That's impossible.
I know when a spell works, and that spell worked right and proper. We're back in ouer time, no doubt about it.
Yeah. This place is...different, somehow.
Swaine...
We made it back. That's all that matters.<NL>Now, isn't there someone we should be helping?
O-Of course! Come on, Oliver, let's find Marcassin!
Sure thing! Let's go give him his <color:#1>belief</color> back!

evf0480_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Wh-What's happening...? What is this warmth that spreads within my breast...?
What have I been doing? All this time I have been so misguided...
It was Shadar, Your Highness.<NL>He took the <color:#1>belief</color> from your heart.
...My heart? My...<color:#1>belief</color>?
Wait! I feel... I believe in people once more! I want to believe in people! It has been so long since I felt this way...
Does this mean...?
Does this mean that you saved me? Was it you who gave me back the capacity to believe?
It was, Your Highness. I did promise, didn't I?
I promised I'd come and help you if you were in trouble. Wherever you were, no matter how far away...
Wherever...I...?
...I see. Ha ha! Now, I see!
You came back. I always knew that you would. Thank you.
There's really no need to thank me, Your Highness.
...Your Highness, we need your help!<NL>We want you to help us to... To defeat Shadar!
What did you say?<NL>You mean to face Shadar?
That is...impossibly reckless. I am a Great Sage, and yet Shadar was able to enter my heart and take a piece of it with impunity...
...And yet I was saved. Just as I was promised...
Very well! I shall assist you. Together, we will defeat the Dark Djinn. Shadar's days are numbered!
They sure are!<NL>Thank you so much, Your Highness!<NL>I knew you wouldn't let us down!
Heh... And that is why you're the Emperor, Marcassin.

evf0490_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Well, well...
What are we to make of this?
It seems the "savior" managed to acquire Mornstar after all...
<KEEP>
And somehow managed to travel back to the present!
I would have thought that far beyond his meager powers.
Indeed.
The power to Breach Time can be used but once in a mortal's life, can it not?
It would seem that he has benefited<NL>from yet more assistance...
And that his benefactor possesses formidable powers.
Powers on a par with our own...
This supposed helper of his is no mere dabbler in the magical arts.
Such powers recall those of that ancient king without whom our magic wands could not exist.
Yes, I speak of my...
But that would be a truly terrifying proposition!<NL>If one such as he were to—
Fear not!
Should the need arise, I shall take action myself...
Your Radiance! You mean to say...?
I do! He cannot hope to defeat me.<NL>And I will tell you why...

evf0500_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...All right, everyone, listen. In order to defeat Shadar, we must first break down his defenses.
Now, the Dark Djinn is protected by a magical barrier known as the "Black Briar."
The Black Briar...?
Yes. It is a cloying magical barrier which no spell can permeate.
Neither Rashaad nor Alicia were able to overcome the Black Briar. That is why Shadar was able to defeat them...
And with the other Great Sages incapacitated, he was able to delve deep into my own heart and steal a piece of it...
But now, Marcassin— Oops! I mean, Your Majesty!
Come along now, Esther—I once fought alongside you as a child. There is no need for you to use my royal title.<NL>The same goes for all of you.
Sure, Your Majesty! Uh...
Ha... Don't worry, Oliver.<NL>I'm sure you'll get used to it.
Now, I would dearly love to accompany you on another journey, one where we grow strong together.<NL>Strong enough to defeat Shadar...
But protecting the Empire has to be my first priority.<NL>There is also the small matter of rectifying the many mistakes I made whilst brokenhearted.
I comfort myself with the knowledge that you now possess a wand that should enable you to defeat Shadar without my aid, Oliver.
Mornstar once belonged to the Wizard King. It is said to have the power to overcome any enchantment.
That must surely include the Black Briar that<NL>protects Shadar...
Unfortunately, however, the wand you have in your possession is not complete.
Eh!? Not complete? What are you on about?
Mornstar's true power is beyond most wizards' comprehension.
It is so powerful, indeed, that the ancient king who created it decided that its power should be divided between <color:#1>three magical stones</color>.
These three stones were then sealed away, far from the wand itself...
So...we need to go find them, right?
Yes... But I have an apology to make in that regard...
Huh? Wh-Why? What have you done?
A <color:#1>map</color> detailing the locations of the three stones was<NL>once in my possession. I am afraid, however, that it has<NL>been stolen.
Stolen!?
While I was brokenhearted, I must confess that I became rather neglectful of the palace's treasures. Books and maps would often disappear...
To my shame, I actually observed several such thefts...<NL>and did nothing.
That sounds about right. I found it hard to care about anything much when I was brokenhearted...
Well this is a bit flipping rum. If the thief who pinched the map uses it to get hold of the stones, what do you think he's going to do with them?
I do not know... What I do know, however, is the identity of the thief.
His name is <color:#1>Kublai</color>. He styles himself "King of the<NL>Sky Pirates."
Kublai...!? Of all the people to tangle with...
I should have known you two would be thick as...erm... Anyway! I don't s'pose you know where he is, do you?
That's the thing with the Sky Pirates. You never know where they are. They're always moving from hideout to hideout on these giant airships...
Be that as it may, locating Kublai is still the easiest way for you to recover the three magical stones.
He is very unlikely to cooperate peacefully, however...<NL>I had better teach you some new spells, Oliver!
You will almost certainly be doing a lot of traveling on your search for Kublai. Therefore, let me grant you one last spell.
What does it do, Your Ma—uh!—Marcassin?
It instantly transports you to any location you have already visited. While I am unable to accompany you on your travels, I can at least make them pass more comfortably.
That's great! And it means we can come and see you any time we like, Marcassin!
Ha... Indeed. Be sure to use it to return to some of the other places you have visited on your journey and find out what has changed.
If you visit the Temple of Trials, for example, you will now be able to take part in the <color:#1>Solosseum Series</color>, organized by my old teacher, Solomon...
Oh wow! I'd almost completely forgotten about Solomon and the Temple of Trials!
Our first priority, though, is to find <color:#1>Kublai, King of the Sky Pirates</color>. Come on, Oliver! The next chapter of our adventure starts here!
It sure does! Let's go!

evg0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Wow! Look, everyone!<NL>It's enormous in here!
And...<NL>My goodness!
What is it, mun?
Neato!<NL>It's a huge ship!
A ship?
Well if it is, it's a pretty flipping weird one! I mean, it's made out of metal, for a start—and it hasn't even got a sail!
No, it hasn't...<NL>So how does it move?
It uses its engines, of course.<NL>...Hang on, you lot don't know what it is, do you?
It's a flying ship.<NL>They call them "airships."
This is an airship?<NL>Then does that mean—?
Yup, I reckon it does...
We've found the King of the Sky Pirates' hideout.
Brilliant!<NL>So Kublai must be somewhere aboard!
Hang on a second—if this is the sky pirates' hideout, where's all the flipping sky pirates? We'd best be careful, you lot!
Gee, I wonder how it flies...<NL>Do you think he'll let us ride it?
Oliver! This is no time to be daydreaming about<NL>flying ships!
Oh, uh... Sorry, you're right. We need to find the<NL><color:#1>Map of the Stones</color>, huh?
Blimey, you're such a kid!
S-Sorry! It won't happen again!
Heh. Only kidding. I know just how you feel.<NL>But let's concentrate on the stones for now, shall we?
Sure, Swaine! Let's sneak aboard and see what<NL>we can find!

evg0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Wow...<NL>It's so big!
It's hard to believe something so huge can actually fly...
Oi, you lot—don't you think we're getting a bit too close a bit too easily? This is what usually happens before...
Avast!<NL>Who goes there?
...a flipping ambush!
O-Oh no!
So, you filthy thieves are here to plunder our plunder?
Heh. I'd take a look in the mirror before calling someone a filthy thief, my friend.
Don't make them angry, Swaine!<NL>They're bloodthirsty sky pirates!
If you knew that, girl, why would you risk your pretty neck trying to sneak aboard?
You're either mighty brave or mighty stupid!
Knickers! We're flipping trapped!<NL>Trapped, I tell you!
Ha! We have company, I see!
<KEEP>
Aye, Captain!
That's...Kublai!
That's him, is it? Crikey, look at the face on him!<NL>There's gruesome!
We... We came here to speak to you!
That's right! We have a favor to ask, Captain Kublai, Sir.
Grahahahaharrr!
You stroll uninvited into my mountain stronghold hoping to be granted a "favor"!?
What are you? Would-be heroes come to take back your plundered treasures? Grahahaharrr!
...Hm?
...By the skies!
Boy, I'll hear you out.<NL>Come aboard!
Hmm...<NL>That's quite a tale, lad.
Aye, 'tis true that I plundered that map. And I'd do it again! That lily-livered fop of a prince had it coming<NL>to him!
Hey, don't talk about Marcassin like th—
Not now, Esther!
We need those magic stones!
Y-Yes, we do!<NL>We need them to help us defeat Shadar!
By the skies! Shadar?<NL>You mean to cross swords with the Dark Djinn?
That we do! We've got to stop him before he breaks the hearts of everyone in ouer world, en't it!
Yeah. Yours included.
Grahahahaharrr! You come aboard my ship and dare to compare me to the sniveling wretches who fall prey<NL>to Shadar?
Let him try and break me! I'll show the scurvy dog what it means to face a true adversary!
Well I'll say this for him—he's not lacking for confidence! Shadar en't to be sniffed at...
There's none knows that better than I, fairy! So...if you're looking to take on Shadar, you'll be possessed of the skills to do so, I take it?
Aye, of course you are! So this'll be child's play for heroes such as yourselves!
Uh...what will...?
Don't fret, lad! It's just a little test of your swashbuckling skills! All in a day's work for a battle-hardened warrior such as yourself! Graharrr!
...Huh?
Wh-What's that sound...?
Aaah! What the—!?

evg0030_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Well, now... There's not many face the old girl's breath and come away unsinged, lad.
You're a plucky one, and no mistake...
.........
Wh-What!? Why would you set her on us if you knew she was that dangerous!?
Yeah, mun! What are you doing calling in a massive great big dragon all of a sudden like that? I nearly flipping<NL>wet myself!
Silence, dogs!
I'll ask the questions here!<NL>The wand—where did you get it?
Wh-What does it matter to you? We won't let you have it! No matter what you do to us!
It matters to me, girl, because the accursed thing's not supposed to exist! The Queen must hear of this...
What queen?
Never you mind! Now, follow me.<NL>The map's aft in my cabin!
All right, grumpy guts...
We're still the good guys, right? I only ask because the King of the Sky Pirates appears to like us...
Eh!? Youer kidding, en't you?
We did it, Oliver!<NL>Let's go and look at the map!
What are you worms waiting for?<NL>Move your scurvy carcasses!

evg0040_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
This is what you came here for—<color:#1>the map of the stones</color>.
This here "X" marks...
...where the stones must be hidden...
A remote island?<NL>Makes sense, I suppose.
Well, what are we waiting for? We've got a ship—let's sail there and find them!
Pipe down, girl. D'you think the boats of those seafaring simpletons could reach where even the mighty Iron Wyvern could not go?
Eh? What the flip are you on about?
It's a sight more complicated than that.
The Wyvern here is too large to land on <color:#1>Solitary Isle</color>.<NL>And the seas around that rotten little rock are riddled<NL>with reefs.
Jeepers...<NL>So we can't get to the stones?
Don't start sniveling just yet, lad.<NL>There's a way there, all right.
...On the back of Tengri, winged dragon, and master of the skies.
None flies faster or higher than the pride of my pack of wild wyrms!
Crikey! There's impressive-sounding!<NL>Come on then, where is this Tengri?
Well now, fairy, there's the rub. Tengri has been struck down with the dreaded lurgy, and flies no longer.
"Lurgy"? You mean he's sick?
Gah, nothing's ever easy, is it?
Don't speak too soon! We have the mighty wizard Oliver on ouer side, after all!
Hm? You mean to heal him?
Well, we can't promise anything, but it's worth a try,<NL>I reckon.
Ollie-boy here's got a spell or two up his sleeve that might get youer dragon friend back on the wing!
Yes! You must have something that will work, Oliver!<NL>Let's go and meet this dragon, shall we?
Sure! Where can we find Tengri, Captain Kublai?
No doubt the great lump will be cowering in a corner of the cave somewhere feeling sorry for himself.<NL>See what you can do.
Thanks! Come on, everyone—we have a dragon to save!
I hope we can help him!
You lot love nothing more than a charity case, do you?

evg0060_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hello, Tengri.<NL>We wanted to talk with you, if that's okay.
Yeah, we heard youer a bit poorly, en't it?<NL>Tell us what's up, mun. Maybe we can help, like.
.........
Look! He's scared, aren't you, Tengri? Poor thing...<NL>There, there... We won't hurt you. Don’t be frightened.
You want to fly again, don't you, Tengri?
Why don't you tell us what's wrong?
...All right.
Go on...
I... I feel strange...<NL>There's a me who isn't me...
...Another me. And he's sick, so...<NL>So...I c-can't fly.
Another Tengri?<NL>Do you think he means...?
Of course! He's got a soul mate over in Ollie-boy's world, en't it?
You mean back in <color:#1>Motorville</color>?
Like Myrtle and I?<NL>But Tengri's a dragon...
That happens too, eh, Ollie-boy? We've seen people with animals for soul mates before, en't it?
You mean like Timmy and King Tom?<NL>Sure we have.
Exactly! And I reckon Tengri's super-sensitive animal mind means he can tell what's going on with his soul mate over by there.
What are you lot talking about?<NL>I don't understand a word you're saying...
(sigh) I really can't be bothered to explain it to you now. I'll tell you afterwards, all right?
Tengri? The other you is sick in his heart.<NL>Do you understand?
In his heart?
Yes. But don't worry—we're going to make him better!
So you'll be able to fly again soon!
...Really?
Really! And when you can fly again, do you think you might let us ride on your back?
...Um, yes. All right.<NL>I'll let you.
Thank you so much, Tengri!<NL>We'll help you, I promise!
Gee, Esther.<NL>That was amazing...
It was, eh. I've got so used to the girl, I clean forgot she had such a way with animals. S'pose she is a familiar keeper after all...
Hee hee! Tengri's not a familiar, silly!
No, and he's not much of a dragon either,<NL>the massive wimp.
You'd be a wimp too if your soul mate was sick! Or have you forgotten what it's like to be attacked by Shadar?
...No. And I won't forget in a hurry, either.
(Hang about...)
(How come she never stepped in like that when we had to fight that flipping red dragon...?)
I'm sure we can do something to help Tengri!<NL>Come on, let's go tell Captain Kublai!
(I'll leave it for now. Don't want to stir up trouble...)

evg0070_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I seem to recall you telling us the mighty Mornstar<NL>was no more...
<KEEP>
And yet somehow the boy managed to acquire it.
Things don't seem to be going according to plan,<NL>do they, Shadar?
What you say is true.
I went to great lengths to destroy the wand<NL>that the boy might never wield its power...
But I could not have known he would<NL>travel through time to obtain it.
That reminds me, Lord Gallus.
You have used that spell...
The one that binds past, present, and future.
Surely not...
Surely you did not meet with this "savior" in the past?
The very thought!<NL>What would I stand to gain from such a meeting?
Perhaps the good lady forgets that it is Shadar who has been charged with the boy's...disposal.
Your Excellencies, there is no cause for alarm.
Everything is in hand, I assure you.
I am the Executor, charged with<NL>bringing destruction to this world.
And I fully intend to fulfill my duties.
In any event, the wand he holds is incomplete.
Without the power of the three stones, Mornstar is weak.
Set against the might of our own wands,<NL>it is a mere toy.
It seems you are quite the expert!
They are lost, are they not?
The stones from which Mornstar's magic powers sprang.
Correct. The magic stones are lost.
But the boy is searching for them now.<NL>Of that I have no doubt.
And how are we to stop him finding them?
When the Wizard King concealed them long ago,<NL>he entrusted their care to three fearsome guardians.
I propose that we awaken the Keepers of the Stones<NL>from their slumber.
Does this plan please you, Your Radiance?
It does.
Listen to me well, Shadar—the Keepers of the Stones shall henceforth answer to you.
I am...honored.
Use your new powers wisely.
The Wizard King's most faithful servants<NL>are now yours to command...

evg0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Righty-ho, Ollie-boy! We need to find Tengri's soul mate then, en't it? Can you think of anyone who reminds you of a massive flying dragon?
You mean, uh...somebody...dragonlike?
Come on, mun! You know everyone in town, don't you?<NL>If you can't think who it might be, just ask around, en't it?

evg0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oh, hi, Oliver!
Hi, Myrtle! Long time no see!<NL>How's it been working for Miss Leila?
I love it! And I'm getting better all the time! I know the names and prices of everything in the store now!
Very impressive, young lady.<NL>Oh, I'm Swaine, by the way.
I don't really like to talk about it, but I've made it my business to protect these poor kids here. I'm what you might call their guardian.
......?
...Er, you know she can't hear you, don't you?
You what!?
Hee hee! People from this world can't see or hear us, silly!
This girl is my soul mate.<NL>Can't you tell?
...Yeah, I suppose I can, now that you mention it.
Yeah, mun, they look just like each other, en't it?<NL>They don't act the same, mind.
Thank goodness for that...
Hey! What's that supposed to mean!?
Oliver...can you hear voices?
Uhh...nope!<NL>No, I can't hear them!
Hmm...weird. Hey, wanna know what they call me around town these days?
People have started calling me the Dairy Fairy!<NL>It's a little embarrassing, but I kinda like it...
Neato! That's so great, Myrtle! I can't believe how much things have changed for you!
You mean now they don't call me Starey Mary anymore? Yeah, I guess things have changed.
Uh, haha...
Woof!<NL>Grrr!
Uh-oh!<NL>There's a mad dog on the loose!
Strange... I feel like I know him from somewhere...<NL>Isn't he sweet, though?
Umm...no.
Hey there, Genghis!<NL>Are you out on your own again, sweetie?
Hey, this dog, it's...
That's right, it's Denny's dog!<NL>You know, Denny who lives next door to me?<NL>They're always out walking together.
Well, I guess you couldn't really call it walking. As soon as school's out, the two of them go running off together all over town!
But I haven't seen Denny lately...
Even though you live next door?<NL>That's weird...
It is, huh. I always know when he leaves the house. I hear him laughing and hollering. At least, I did until recently...
You mean he hasn't been going outside?
Maybe, yeah...<NL>Maybe he's like I was...
Crikey, you mean now we've cured Starey Mary, we've got Glarey Cary to deal with instead? Typical!
Glarey...Cary...?
(Mr. Drippy!!!)
(What, mun!? I thought she couldn't flipping hear me!)
Grrr!<NL>Aooo!
What are you getting so worked up about?
...I think he wants to tell us something.
Huh? Genghis?<NL>What could he want?
Looks like another case for the heroic wizard who can talk to the animals!
Don't make fun of him! Oliver... I know we're supposed to be looking for Tengri's soul mate, but...
Please...could we speak to Genghis?
Sure!<NL>Let's hear what he has to say!
Just a second, Myrtle.<NL>I need to ask Genghis what's wrong.
Uh...sure.<NL>...How, exactly?
Oh, I, uh... I mean, I need to see if he has any clues, you know, being Denny's pet and all...
Shut up, mun!<NL>Youer making it worse!
Hee hee! You can be awfully strange sometimes, Oliver... Anyway, I have to open the store. I'll see you<NL>around, okay?

evg0100_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Grrr! Why won't you listen to me!?<NL>How many times do I have to tell you?<NL>My master—he's in trouble!
Blimey! Sounds serious...
Grrruh?<NL>Oh, you're listening now, are you?
And you can see us?
Sure I can! You're not exactly easy to miss!<NL>How come you suddenly started listening?
Of course! He can see us 'cause animals are all sensitive and that, en't it? Oh, and we were listening, Dogface, we just couldn't understand till Ollie-boy cast the spell, en't it.
Grrruh?
Well, you seemed so upset, we had to find a way of speaking to you... There's something you want to tell us, isn't there, Genghis, sweetie?
Grrrrrrrrr!!!<NL>Sweetie...?
Oh! Sorry!<NL>I meant "Mr. Genghis, Sir"!
Grrrmph. Stupid humans...<NL>Anyway, I'll tell you again.
My master, Denny, is the greatest athlete this town has ever seen...
And I'm his best friend, the King of the Dogs!<NL>You can call me Genghis...
I could swear I know someone who talks just like you...
I was thinking just the same thing...<NL>In fact...
Doesn't Genghis kinda look like somebody we know, too?
It's Mr. Genghis, Oliver!<NL>But yes, I had the same feeling...
Who the flip could it be now...?
Kublai!
How could we not have spotted it?<NL>Just look at his expression!
Ha! Could be old Pirateface's head on another body, now I look at it properly! There's sharp-eyed of you, Ollie-boy!
He talks just like him, too. Kinda...rough. It's funny, huh? Over in your world, Kublai keeps dragons, but here, he's somebody's pet.
Hey!<NL>Do you think...?
What, mun?<NL>Spit it out!
Tengri's soul mate...could it be Denny?
What makes you say that?<NL>Does he look like a dragon or something?
...Oh, I get you! Kublai and Tengri are proper close, en't it? So it makes sense Genghis here would be close with Tengri's soul mate!
Exactly!
But that would mean Kublai's pet in our world is his master in this one...
The old switcheroo, eh?<NL>Classic stuff!
Grrr! Stop yapping and listen to me, will you?
Oh. Sorry, Mr. Genghis, Sir.
Are you listening now? Good. Until recently, my master and I spent all our time training.
You did, huh. I used to see you running around town all the time.
Well, of course you did! We were working for our dream! For my master's dream of making the state championships!
You were helping him train?
Grrr! I just said that, didn't I?<NL>Anyway, he didn't make the track team.<NL>Nobody ever said life was easy, after all...
Tell me about it...
But he didn't give up! Not my master!<NL>He just trained harder than ever!
That's the spirit! That's just what I imagine someone with a friend like you would do!
But then...it happened. Grrr... Maybe he trained too hard... Maybe I didn't look after him well enough...
He went and got himself injured, did he?<NL>Is that why he's not been out and about lately?
I didn't think it was anything serious... I thought he would be fine... And by the time I noticed, it was too late.
So that's what's behind it all, eh?
Grrr... He lost his confidence. He was so convinced he would make the team next time, and then suddenly...<NL>he was different.
Hey! I bet he's...
Heartbroken?<NL>Could be, Ollie-boy, could well be!
That would explain why Tengri can't fly, too, huh?
Then we have to help him!<NL>Mr. Genghis, Sir—can you take us to your master?
Grrr! You think you can fix him? Fools!<NL>He's seen all the best doctors, and they couldn't help.<NL>What makes you so special?
It's nothing a doctor can fix, mun! It's his heart, see—<NL>it's broken. And we just happen to specialize in mending broken hearts.
Mr. Genghis, Sir, you have to trust us!<NL>I think we can help Denny!
Grrr... Fine. But if you hurt him, I'll bury your bones in our back garden. You know our house, don't you? I'll wait for you there.
Heh. Same old story, eh? Well, I don't suppose there's any harm in Kublai owing us one in this world as well.
You're still here, Oliver?<NL>Did Genghis give you any clues?
He sure did! It's bad news, Myrtle!<NL>Denny's hurt!
He is? Oh, that's terrible! I had no idea!<NL>Wait... Did you really...talk to Genghis?
I, no...I just...figured it out... And it's worse than that...<NL>I think his heart may be broken too!
I have to help him!<NL>I have to mend him!
S-Sorry, Myrtle...<NL>You have no idea what I'm talking about, huh?
...Maybe not, but I believe in you.<NL>You used...magic to heal me, didn't you?
...Yes.
Hey, Oliver. Can I come with you?<NL>Denny and I were good friends once...
And when I couldn't go outside...you helped me so much.
Maybe I can help you this time...
Gee, Myrtle...<NL>Thank you...
That's okay.
She's a nice girl, eh?
Hee hee! Of course she is!<NL>She's my soul mate!

Yes! But I can't take you any further than this.

S-Sure.

Grrr! Of course I'm sure!<NL>He's in there on his own!
Can't you just use magic to unlock it, mun?
Let me call him for you!

I don't know, do I? But it seemed like she could hear me a bit didn't it? Maybe she's more sensitive to these things than most...
Dammit. It's hard to see her so upset and not be able to do anything about it...
Yes...
Oi, Ollie-boy, you know it's not as simple as just beating the Nightmare, en't it?
Oh, it's like when it happened to me, is it?<NL>So what piece of heart is he missing?
I just can't keep up...<NL>I'll never catch them...
He's lacking <color:#1>confidence</color>, isn't he?<NL>Oliver, we need to get some from somewhere!
Sure!<NL>Denny, Myrtle...
Oliver...<NL>I think I understand what Denny was feeling...
It was just like when it happened to me...<NL>Oh, my... What can I do to help him?
It's all right, Myrtle.<NL>I'll help him, I promise!
Oliver...
Denny! Wait!<NL>I need to mend your heart!
What do you know about my heart? I didn't make the cut. It's that simple. And now, with my injury...I don't deserve to run.
They'll all overtake me...<NL>They'll all leave me behind...<NL>And there's nothing you or I can do about it!
Oh, Denny...
Myrtle, I need you to do something for me. I can help Denny, but...I can't do it right away.
So I need you to look out for him for a little while.<NL>Can you do that for me? Can you stay with him?
S-Sure, Oliver.<NL>Anything I can do to help.
Thanks, Myrtle.<NL>I'll be back real soon!
This is all very heroic of you, Ollie-boy, but have you got any idea where we can find some <color:#1>confidence</color> in a hurry? En't like it grows on trees, is it?
Well, I... Uh...
It doesn't matter! Let's just go back and visit all the places we've been to so far!
Back in our world, you mean? Yeah. Why not? There's got to be someone somewhere with more confidence than's good for them.
Thanks, you guys.<NL>Let's go find some <color:#1>confidence</color>!

...Myrtle?
Denny! (gasp) I can feel it! The pain in his heart...<NL>It's disappearing...
Woof!
Hey, boy! You're here, too! I'm so sorry...<NL>I've caused everybody so much trouble...
It's not your fault!<NL>You were...uh...
My...my heart... It feels so...light...<NL>Like a weight has been lifted...<NL>You did this, didn't you?
He did! And he did the same for me, Denny!<NL>Oliver knows how to use magic spells!
Heh. I'd be surprised hearing that from anyone<NL>but you, Myrtle.
Wait! No, I...uh...
Hee hee! Don't worry, Oliver.<NL>He doesn't actually believe her.
Aooo! Woof!
You're right, Genghis.<NL>We need to get back in training!
B-But Denny! Your leg...<NL>Are you sure you should?
Ha! That? It was just a scratch! I can't sit around feeling sorry for myself because of that!
The longer I sit around, the faster the others get! I can't let them beat me! I have to make the cut next time!
Hee hee! That's the Denny I know!<NL>Good luck!
Ha! Thanks, but I won't need it!<NL>Come on, boy! It's training time!<NL>I can feel myself getting slower by the second!
Crikey! He doesn't look too slow to me!
Hee hee! Looks like he's forgotten all about his injury! That's the power of the heart!
You did it again, Oliver...<NL>Thank you so much...
It wasn't me, Myrtle. It was Denny.<NL>His heart was strong enough to make it.<NL>I just...gave it a helping hand.
You really are a hero, aren't you?<NL>Maybe even a handsome prince!
Wh— Cut it out, Myrtle! Hey, I sure hope Denny makes the state championships, don't you?
Hee hee! Of course I do!
Heh. It won't be easy, but something tells me he'll make it.
Of course he will!<NL>Especially now we've helped him on the way!
...Oh no!<NL>I have to get back to the store!
Huh?<NL>What's wrong, Myrtle?
I was in the middle of opening up!<NL>Miss Leila will be so mad!
Wh— You were working?<NL>Jeepers! You need to get back there!
Heh heh. She's just as easily distracted as someone else I could mention...
Oh yes? And who might that be?
.........

evg0160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I'm so sorry, Miss Leila!<NL>I didn't mean to leave the store like that!
Myrtle, dear! Where have you been?<NL>I was worried about you!
Look! It's Esther and the other one!<NL>Hee hee!
And who might you be, sweetie?
This little lady's been around an awful lot lately!
Eh? What little lady?
There you are! Hello, Oliver!<NL>I've been looking for you!
Pea?
Pea?<NL>She's here somewhere?
Hee hee! Is she a friend of yours, Oliver?<NL>Then I'll leave you two and get back to work.<NL>See you soon!
Well, it looks like you've found who you were looking for, dearie. I'll leave you with Oliver, shall I?
Thanks, Miss Leila!<NL>Have a nice day!
Oliver!<NL>I have to tell you something!
I'm sorry, Pea. What is it?
Eh? Who's he saying sorry to?
Oliver! The slithery one and the doggy one and the boney one! They're coming!
The Keepers!<NL>You have to be careful!
I...I don't understand, Pea...
Yes you do!<NL>Just be careful!
Okay, Pea. I'll try...
Er...what!?<NL>Who were you just talking to?
Huh? Oh, gee. I'm sorry. You don't know about Pea yet, do you, Swaine?
She's a funny little girl I know.<NL>I see her here in Motorville sometimes.<NL>I've seen her in my dreams, too...
But we can't see her.
No. I still can't figure out why...<NL>Do you know why, Pea?
...Huh?
She's gone!<NL>She always does this!
What's wrong?<NL>Did she disappear again?
Uh-huh... And I didn't understand what she was trying to tell me.
Ahh, I think I get it...
Get what, Drippy?
Well, Myrtle and that lot can't see us lot from ouer world, right? So, that means Pea probably can't see us lot either, en't it?
It's the same but the other way around, you mean?
That's right. It's not so weird when you think about it, eh? Us not being able to see someone from another world...
Uh...it's not...?
Oh, who cares, as long as you can see her, eh, Oliver?
Yeah. I'm more worried about going and seeing how Tengri's doing. If your guess was right, Oliver...
En't it, though! We've sorted Denny out, so Tengri should be able to fly again! Tidy!
You're right!<NL>Let's go check on Tengri!

evg0170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...That sound!
Hm? Ah!
Tengri!
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Behold! He's a sight for sore eyes, and no mistake!<NL>He stopped sniveling and took to the skies again not long after you left.
Like magic, it was... Wait—you meddling dogs did something while my back was turned, didn't you?
Well, it's a little hard to explain, but...we went to another world and Oliver helped the Tengri there get better...
All you need to know is that Oliver's magic is the reason that Tengri is flying again!
Grahahahaharrr! Still spouting nonsense, I see!<NL>But no matter—you did as you said you would.<NL>I'll not question your methods.
Hee hee! I had no idea the real Tengri was so lively!<NL>This is how dragons should be!
Hm. Seems he's taken a liking to you.<NL>And after all my hard work...
...Gah, so be it! I know when I'm beaten.<NL>He's yours. You're his master now, lad.<NL>You and he both know it already.
Wh— Really? But...
What's the matter, worm?<NL>Not good enough for you?
N-No! No, Sir!<NL>Th-Thank you very much, Captain Kublai, Sir!
Grahahahaharrr! That's settled, then!<NL>Tengri, lad—say hello to your new master!
Kyah!<NL>Kyaaaah!
Hee hee! Nice to meet you too, Tengri!
Likewise, I'm sure.
All right!<NL>Let's go find the magic stones!
Set a southward course, lad.<NL>You'll happen upon <color:#1>Solitary Isle</color> soon enough!
Kyah!
Whoa! Ti-i-idy!!!
We're flying! We're actually flying!
It's nice and comfy up here!
Come on, Tengri!
Let's fly!
Away we go!

evg0200_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hmm...<NL>It was definitely the right island...
Here, Ollie-boy—give the Nazcaän from that monument thingy another read. That'll tell you the secret, I'll bet!
"<color:#1>The secret that the map imparts,<NL>Lies not without but in its heart.</color>"<NL>...What could it mean?
Well, the heart stuff always has something to do with your magic, right?
So should we cast <color:#8>Take Heart</color> on it or something?
Eh? Cast it on the map? And what would we do with what we got from it? If we got anything, that is...
But it could be something to do with magic, right?
Yeah...that tends to be the case where you're involved...
You put a good deal of faith in the boy's wizarding.<NL>Does he know many spells?
Oh, lots and lots!<NL>People just keep giving them to him!
Youer not wrong, Esther... We've got a tidy pile of spells now, en't it... I reckon we must have something<NL>that'll work.
"<color:#1>The secret that the map imparts,<NL>Lies not without but in its heart.</color>"<NL>Do any of your spells spring to mind, Oliver?
Gee, one or two, maybe...<NL>Well, there's only one way to find out!

evg0210_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tidy!<NL>We've hit the flipping jackpot!
So they were hidden separately... I had my suspicions. There are three stones after all. To hide them in one place seemed...foolhardy.
Hang on, I'm not sure I understand—what made all the marks appear on the map?
It was the spell I used—<color:#8>Insight</color>. It shows you the memories of the people who once owned an object.
I get it. So it showed you the places that the person who made the map wanted to keep secret.
Yeah... The memories just came rushing into my mind all at once... And there was a message, too...
Well? What was it? Spit it out, mun!
Uh, let me see...
"The wand is the weapon of the heart...<NL>The stones merely reflect its surface...<NL>True power lies in the depths..."
...That's all it said.
What the heck's that s'posed to mean when it's at home?
Hmm. I'm sure we'll find out eventually. Let's think about it while we look for the stones, shall we?
Fair enough. Here, Pirateface, will you give us a lend of the map? It'll be a right faff coming back here all the time to check it.
The stones are your concern. I have no need of the map. Take it—it will free up more space for good,<NL>honest plunder!
Thank you very much, Captain! We'll go see what we can find at the <color:#1>three places marked on the map</color>!
Then it looks like we'll be spending plenty of time up in the clouds with Tengri! I can't wait!
Heh. Yeah, we'll be keeping him busy all right.
Tidy! It's time to begin the next chapter in The Adventures of the Intrepid Wizard Ollie-Boy:<NL>The Search for the Magic Stones!

evh0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Gah...where have we ended up this time?<NL>I've known prisons that looked more inviting.
Another damp old ruin, is it? Knickers. My lantern's going to end up covered in mold—caked, I tell you!
Does that lantern really go moldy...?
Uh... You know, that's not really important right now.
Youer not wrong there, Ollie-boy—it looks like we've found the place we're after! One of them <color:#1>magic stones</color> should be somewhere in here!

evh0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I'm not feeling any better about this place.<NL>I just wish it could be a bit less...creepy...
Take this, for example: a statue of a snake. Who in their right mind would choose that as an ornament? A nutter, that's who!
Hold on... Are you saying you're scared of snakes, Swaine?
O-Of course not! And what is it to you if I am, anyway? Why do you—
Hey, did anybody else just see that!?
...Huh?
Just now, the statue's eyes—they glowed...
Ohh, I see—trying to be funny, are you?<NL>Well it doesn't suit you, Oliver...
AAARGH!
...Ribbit!?<NL>(Huh!?)
Rarebit! Rarebit!?<NL>(What the flipping heck is going on!?)
RRRibbit... Ribbit...?<NL>(Have we...turned into frogs?)
Rob-it! R-R-Rob-it! RRRRRRob-it!?<NL>(It's a c-c-curse! What are we going to do!?)
Rarebit! Rarebit, rarebit!<NL>(Don't make such a fuss, mun. It's not like it's made us smaller or anything!)
RRROB-IT!<NL>(Speak for yourself!)
Ribbit... Ribbit rrribbit!?<NL>(So... How are we going to turn back to normal!?)
Ribbit, ribbit.
Ribbit!?<NL>(...What's that!?)
Ribbit, ribbit?
RRRibbit! Ribbit, ribbit!<NL>(Gosh! What a colorful frog!)
Ribbit, ribbit!
Ribbit! Ribbit, ribbit!?<NL>(W-Wait up! Where are you going!?)
Rarebit! Rarebit, rarebit!?<NL>(Was that frog cursed by the statue as well, then?)
RRRibbit...? Ribbit!?<NL>(Do you think it's actually a human?<NL>Someone who came here before us...)
Ribbit! Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!<NL>(Maybe it knows something about this place!<NL>Let's go after it!)

Rarebit? Rarebit, rarebit...<NL>(Hmm? I'm sure that frog came over by here...)
Ribbit, ribbit...

...Woohoo! We're back to normal!
Phew... The novelty of being a frog wears off pretty quickly, eh?
I know! And having to speak in that awful frog language was just so tiring!
Too rarebit, mun! Er, I mean, too right!
Heh. Looks like Drippy misses his old froggy form... Anyway, we should get back to searching for that stone.
Wait! What if...? I think that rainbow-colored frog was trying to lead us here!
So why hasn't it changed back into a human like we did? Maybe it was just a normal frog all along.
Hmm. I don't know. But it is curious...
Well, I'm sure we'll bump into it again before long, en't it? Now then, let's start looking for that <color:#1>stone</color>, shall we?
Sure thing! Let's take a look around these ruins!

Where are we...?
Crikey... This place is a bit blinking grim.<NL>Must be a prison or something...
Is there...someone there?
AAARGH! Wh-Who's that!?
It's a f-f-flipping frog! Another one!
...Another one? Do you mean to say that someone else has been blighted by my curse...?
A-Actually...we were cursed and turned into frogs ourselves. But we didn't look like you do...
...Leave, now! You must leave this place!<NL>It is dangerous!
Huh!? B-But you—
Do not waste time worrying about me. Nghhh...
What's the matter!? Are you hurt?
Oh, Oliver! We've got to do something!
Yes! We have to help him! I guess I can use magic to get this door open... Let's give it a try!

evh0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Nghhh... What are you doing!?<NL>Leave me alone, I beseech you!
Wait a minute... Are you...?<NL>Are you the Frog Prince!?
You know who I am!? But how!?
"The Frog Prince of the Desert..."<NL>That's you, isn't it? The one who left his kingdom, abandoning his princess!
Ngh! How do you—!?
What are you going on about, Esther!?<NL>Are you trying to confuse us or something?
Hmph! It wouldn't take much to confuse the likes of you, Swaine! I'm just a bit shocked, all right?
I didn't think we were going to bump into a prince from a fairy tale, did I!?
A fairy tale!?
Ngh... I see... So that is how you know of me...
Now let me think... Ah yes! I remember.<NL>All right, listen carefully...
"Once upon a time, before the fathers of our fathers' fathers were born,<NL>there was a magnificent desert kingdom.
"In that kingdom lived a handsome and courageous young prince<NL>who was much loved by all his subjects.
"Then one day, the kingdom was attacked by a monstrous serpent.<NL>A beast so hideous that it struck fear into all who saw it.<NL>A terrible, evil creature...
"The prince decided that, in order to defeat this serpent,<NL>he would have to drink a certain mysterious potion.
"No sooner had he swallowed the diabolical draught<NL>than he began to turn into a frog—"
What!? Why would he drink a potion that turned him into a frog? A frog doesn't stand a chance of beating a snake!
I haven't finished the story yet! I told you to listen carefully, didn't I—not ask stupid questions!
Now, where was I? Ah yes!<NL>The reason he decided to turn into a frog was—
To lull the serpent into a false sense of security by becoming one of its favored foodstuffs...if I<NL>recall correctly.
Ahem! Y-Yes!
My apologies. Please continue.
"And so, the prince turned himself into a frog.<NL>For he had a plan.
"He knew the serpent would not be able to resist eating him,<NL>and that this would allow him to attack the monster from within...
"The plan worked. The serpent swallowed the prince,<NL>and received a mortal blow from inside for its trouble.
"But alas, the prince could not return to his original form.
"No matter what he tried,<NL>he remained an ugly frog.
"This caused him great distress.<NL>He could not stop thinking about how foolish he had been.
"So he vowed to hide himself away from the world...
"Now, the prince was married to a beautiful young princess.
"Though he had promised her that they would be together<NL>forever and ever...
"...she had not seen him since he left to face the serpent.<NL>It began to seem that he would never return...
"Despairing, the princess went to the tomb where<NL>the prince had slain the serpent, and wept for her lost love.
"And there she remained, waiting for her prince,<NL>though she knew he would never come..."
"...Waiting until the end of her days."
Hm. She waited, you say?<NL>I see that it truly has become a fairy tale.
Gee... That's a pretty sad story...
Every girl in Al Mamoon is told that story when they're young, and everyone cries the first time they hear it...
You speak of it as if it were a work of fiction...
Oh! I'm sorry, Prince Ali...
Prince Ali... It has been a very long time since anyone has called me by my name...
Well then—shall I tell you the final chapter of your<NL>fairy tale?
The final chapter...?
"So, the prince left his princess behind, and turned his back on his kingdom.
"The princess's name was Yasmina, by the way. She was the love of the prince's life, and yet...he abandoned her!
"Many years passed, and the prince remained a frog, only to find, to his dismay, that he was unable to die.<NL>Yes, he was destined to live as a frog forever...
"Even after his kingdom had been razed to the ground..."
That's just terrible...
Ha! I may have suffered, but it is nothing compared to the pain I caused my beloved Yasmina. Indeed, I feel sometimes that this is just punishment...
But...why are you in this cell, Your Highness?
It is the serpent, <color:#1>Aapep</color>...<NL>He has returned. Someone brought him back to life...
I don't think there are many people who could breathe new life into an ancient monster...
Yeah. I can only think of one...
You mean...Shadar!?
Aapep wasted no time in taking his revenge.<NL>That is how I came to be imprisoned here.
Who can say how long he intends to prolong my agony? Have I not suffered enough? To remain in this form...<NL>To live without my beloved...
Oliver! Isn't there a spell you can cast to bring Prince Ali back to normal?
You mean something to lift the curse that turned him into a frog? Hmm...
Hang on a flipping minute, mun! Why don't we use that <color:#1>magic circle</color> that lifted ouer froggy curse?
You're right!<NL>It worked for us—maybe it would work for him!
But...surely you did not consume the same shape-shifting potion that I did?
Well, it wasn't a potion, no... But that's not important right now. Come on, Your Highness, let's give that magic circle a try!
Could such magic truly reside in this temple? ...And what if I were to become human again? What new torments would Aapep devise for me then...?
You mustn't think about things like that, Your Highness! We have to try, at least! Now, come with us. We'll take you straight to the <color:#1>magic circle</color>!

evh0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Prince Ali! This is the magic circle that lifted our curse!
A magic circle... Could such a thing really have the same effect on me?
Well, there's only one way to find out!
...Yes. You are right.
What...?
I don't understand... He's standing in the magic circle just like we did, but nothing's happening...
The poor fellow's been like that for thousands of years.<NL>We were only cursed for a few minutes...
I'm so sorry, Prince Ali. I didn't mean to get your<NL>hopes up...
There is no need to apologize. I was rather expecting this to happen.
I do not believe my curse will be lifted while Aapep draws breath. He is doubtless using his own foul magic to strengthen its hold.
Well, then. It's pretty obvious what we need to do, en't it!?
Mr. Drippy's right! There's only one thing for it!
Surely not... Surely you are not going to try and defeat Aapep!? That would be unspeakably reckless!
I... I shall assist you! I must... Ngh...
No! You can't fight him, Prince Ali.<NL>Not in your condition...
Don't worry, Prince Ali! You can count on us!<NL>We'll defeat Aapep and lift your curse!
I... I believe you.<NL>Something about you makes me believe...
<color:#1>Aapep</color> lurks deep within these ruins.<NL>I shall take you to him.

evh0100_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
What in the—!?

evh0115_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
This is it! One of Mornstar's magic stones!
So that slimy Aapep had it all along, did he?<NL>Good work, Ollie-boy!
I am...speechless. I can scarcely believe that Aapep has been defeated. And yet...
Ugh...
P-Prince Ali!?
I-Is th-this...?
It's the curse! The curse is lifting!
Uggghhh... I'm...
Prince Ali!
Wow! It's a miracle!<NL>He's human again, after all these years!
It seems I...have returned to normal.
Too right you have!<NL>So what are you still looking so glum for!?
Though I am human once more, my kingdom is naught but ruins. And she... She is long gone.
Our story has already become a fairy tale.<NL>Everyone knows how it ends...
But Your Highness—
Ribbit...
Huh? You're that frog we saw before!<NL>Where have you been all this time?
A...frog?
You know, this frog helped us back when we were cursed. In fact, it led us straight to you...
Truly? How very—
H-Huh!?
Where the heck did she come from!?
S-Surely not...<NL>Surely this is impossible!
Yasmina! My beautiful Princess Yasmina!
Huh...?
HUH!?
Ali... I have been waiting for you.<NL>Waiting for so long...
And I was a frog as well! Just like you!
Is this...a dream!? Are you really...? But how...?
Hang on a minute... So that colorful frog we saw was actually...a princess!?
I...I think I'm going to cry...
I drank the same potion as you, Ali. The potion that changed you into a frog. The one that cursed you...
I thought...if I were cursed as well, then you would not be alone...
You did this...for me?
I always believed that we would meet again, Ali.<NL>I knew that your curse would be lifted one day.<NL>I had only to wait...
And wait...
Yasmina!
Ali!

evh0120_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart... You need not worry about us anymore. We are together again, and that is all that matters.
Yes! We will finally be able to spend our lives together, just as we always wished...
But where are you going to go? I didn't want to mention it, like, but youer kingdom... Well, it en't what it was.<NL>Seen better days, and all that.
That is true... Though this is also a magnificent city in its own right. I feel sure that we can make it our home.
Indeed. It is a fine city... And we should not dwell on the past. We should think about what we can contribute to the world of today.
Hee hee! Have you considered becoming babana merchants? My father really enjoys it—and the free babanas are a real bonus!
Babanas...? What are they?
Oh, right... I suppose they didn't have babanas back in your day. You really should try one, Your Highness. They're delicious!
They sound wonderful!<NL>I cannot wait to taste my first babana!
Heh. It's nice to see you smiling. You're really lucky to have been given a second chance at happiness, you know. Don't let it slip away.
Swaine's right! You've waited thousands of years<NL>for this moment!
Indeed. And it is thanks to you that it has finally arrived.
You know, Esther, I think you'd better change the ending of that fairy tale.
Oh, yes! Absolutely!
Hee hee... And what will the new ending be?
Hmm... Let me think...
Please, wait! Do not be so hasty in writing the ending of our story, I beseech you.
...Yeah. I suppose this fairy tale isn't over yet, is it?
Certainly not. Indeed, I feel that it is...
...to be continued!
Hee hee!
Ha ha!
Erm... Right! Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I reckon the happy couple might want some time alone.
Oh! Of course!
Huh? Why?
You've got a lot to learn, Ollie-boy, you really have...<NL>Anyway, that's quite enough talking—let's get walking! We've got things to do, you know!
Yes, we should go. I'm sure we'll be seeing this fairy-tale couple again soon, anyway!

evi0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Aaahhhhhh!<NL>It's a gh-gh-ghost ship!
D-Don't be so silly, Swaine.<NL>I'm sure there's a much simpler explanation...
The girl is correct. It is no ghost ship.
S-So what the heck is it, then!?
It is a ghost galleon.
A gh-ghost g-g-g-galleon!?
Look closely. There are many cannons protruding from the sides, are there not?
It is one of the legendary and most fearsome warships constructed for the conflicts of the ancients.<NL>...Or the ghost of one, at least.
So it's even worse than a ghost ship!?
Hahahahaharrr! That it be, shipmates! Worse than the worstest nightmare ye've ever had! Arrr!
...Hm?<NL>Whose voice is that?
They who come alongside the Black Porpoise unbidden end their voyages at the bottom o' Davy Jones's Locker! 'Tis the law o' the seas!
Davy who? I'm Drippy, mun!<NL>Youer thinking of someone else!

Hahahahaharrr! What's the matter, girl? Did the gulls take yer eyes? I be right here! Aharrr!
...Huh?
Ahhh! It's him!
Hahahahaharrr! Ye gave Jetsam a sound scuppering!<NL>Ye've backbone, I'll lay to that.
...But not a bit as much backbone as me an' me scurvy crew, here! We're bone from keel to topsail, ain't we, boys?
Hahahaharrr! Why, Cap'n, ye're the wittiest skipper ever to sail the seven seas! Hahaharr!
I'll make no bones about it, Cap'n—ye're a regular laugh riot! Hahahaharrr!
Crikey... It wasn't that flipping funny...
Wh-What are you people, anyway?<NL>You're not really skeletons, are you?
...Well now, shipmate, I be the dreaded Cap'n Crossbones!
Skipper an' master o' this here tub we calls the Black Porpoise, an' scourge of every inch of ocean from<NL>here to eternity!
Arrr, Cap'n, ye've a fine way with words!
'Tis poetry, Cap'n! Pure poetry!
Now then, state yer purpose—what business have ye with me an' me cutthroat crew?
We're looking for the three magic stones.<NL>And the map brought us here...
Hahahahaharrr! Here to rob us of our treasures, are ye,<NL>by thunder?
An' not just any treasure, but the very jewel given us by the Wizard King hisself? Ohh, ye're plucky ones, I'll give ye that!
...Huh? So he...
He's got the flaming thing, has he?<NL>It would have to be him, wouldn't it?<NL>Flipping typical, this is!
We seadogs values our treasures more than our very lives themselves! Why, we'd die for the least little trinket amongst them!
...If we weren't already dead, o' course!<NL>Hahahaharrr!
Hahahahahahaharrr!!! Another, Cap'n!<NL>Another jest fit to slay a man! Harrr!
Haharrr! I've died all over again!
Um... Call me silly, but I'm starting to like these skeletons...
This swollen-headed fool is the legendary captain? Pah!
The stone is the greatest treasure in all our holds full o' plunder! Ye'll have to prize it from me cold dead hands, ye scurvy dogs!
But... But we need it!<NL>Whatever it takes, we have to have it!
Hahahaharrr!<NL>Whatever it takes, ye say?
Very well, lad. If ye want it, ye'd best come an' get it!<NL>Them's the rules o' the sea! Have at ye!!!
<KEEP>
へぇい！！
Arrr!

Aaaaaarrr...gh.
Ye scurvy dogs...

evi0120_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Arrrgh, no! Cap'n!<NL>Don't die on us, Cap'n!
Hahaharrr...<NL>What do ye mean, lads...? I be dead already...!
Cap'n!!!
Arrr, this is all your doing, ye meddlin' scalawags!
Pah! You call us thieves, you attack us, and then you have the gall to accuse us of meddling? Worms!
Wait...<NL>I don't think they're bad people.
"People"...? Arr, it's been a while since we've been called that, lad.... An age, in fact...
Aye, that it has... Remember the golden olden days?<NL>The slip of a sloop we started out piratin' on all them years back... Arr...
Oh, talk amongst yourselves, why don't you?
Arr, remember the Cap'n in them days? What a terror! Drove us like slaves, he did! Till we was honored by the Wizard King hisself!
Afeared of nothin', we were!<NL>'Twas a golden age for men o' fortune!
From horizon to horizon, the sea was our big, blue oyster! We'd have sailed the Black Porpoise to world's end<NL>an' beyond!
Arr, but we wasn't destined to live forever.<NL>Time caught up with us, sure as the tide...
Aye, that it did! And then we was naught but salt-soaked souls, becalmed on the seas o' the afterlife...
Until the Cap'n came back to us, that is!<NL>Just as we always knew he would!
An' we took to the waves once more!<NL>Arrr, never a happier day did I see!
Never indeed! What more could a cutthroat crew have wished for in death?
Aye! We've been lucky indeed!<NL>Truly, I've no regrets! Nay, not a one!
Hahaharrr... Not even that ye were born with the face of a week-dead dugong,<NL>ye mangy scoundrel?
Hahahahahaharrr! Arr, Cap'n, ye've outdone yourself!
I've wet me pirate pants! Hahaharrr!
Arr, so there ye have it, stone-thieves! We've had ourselves a fine<NL>last jaunt on the ocean wave! 'Tis time to head for harbor!
...Uh, okay.
Anchors...aweigh...!
Arrrrrrrrrrrr!!!
.........
Well, they seemed happy.
Yeah, seems like things worked out all right for them in the end, eh? I can think of worse ways to go...
I suppose you're right.<NL>Do you really think they're gone for good, though?
Somehow, they didn't seem like the types to hang up their cutlasses and settle down to a nice, peaceful afterlife...

evj0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Wow! This place is amazing!
It sure is! Look at the lights coming through the snow...<NL>It's beautiful!
And look at those big fluffy things! I've never seen one before! What are they?
Them? Oh, they're called tomtes, en't it. You only get them by here in the Winter Isles. Everywhere else is too warm for them, see?
Really? Wow! They're so cute!
Yeah, yeah, they're lovely, but can we talk about this inside? I think I can feel my blood turning to ice...
I'll second that emotion! Freezing my bits off, I am!<NL>Brrrrrrrrrrrr!

evj0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ohhh! Hello to you!<NL>You are being...
You are being Oliver, yes?
Crikey, Ollie-boy! There you were with tomtes for butties, and you never even told us! There's secretive, you are!
No, you, uh...I don't...<NL>Who are you? How do you know my name?
I am learning it from my teacher, yes?<NL>She is being your biggest fan!
Your teacher?
My teacher, yes. She is coming to our village to study the ancient archaeology. I am being her pupil, yes?<NL>Hello to you! I am being Åke.
You're studying archaeology?<NL>But you're a...snow...person.
Yes, a tomte, yes. I am being Åke!
Hello there, Åke! Purrhaps you'd like to introduce me to your new friends?
Ohhh! Teacher! Hello to you!<NL>You are being very late, yes?
Oh—Oh, my! Oliver!!!
Goodness! This is such a purrivilege! Imagine—the great wizard Oliver coming all the way out here to this frozen corner of the world!
But oh, how purrfectly rude of me—I must introduce myself! I'm Tabitha. I'm a researcher and purrofessor.
I've been reading all about your exploits in the Daily Yarn! You're quite the news purrsonality!
The Daily Yarn, eh? That's how you grimalkins learn what's going on in the world, en't it?
Well, aren't you a knowledgeable little thing! Yes, the Daily Yarn is the purremier news purrovider for grimalkin across the world.
And lately, we've all been glued to the tales of<NL>your adventures!
Gee, that's... Thank you, Ma'am.<NL>It's kinda embarrassing, but...thanks.
What purrfect nonsense! Embarrassing? Don't be silly! You're a hero! Oh, by the way—I have something to tell you!
You're here in search of one of the magic stones to help restore your wand to its former glory, aren't you?
How did you—?<NL>Yes! That's exactly why we're here!
Then you're in luck! I am a purrofessor of archaeology, you see. And I'm going to tell you everything I know about Mornstar!
Crikey, what are the chances of that, eh?<NL>There's a turn-up for the books!
Mmmyahaha, not at all! Now, according to my research, Mornstar was fashioned by none other than the Wizard King himself.
And, just purrior to settling down to his eternal slumber, he divided the incredible power of the wand, and sealed it inside the three magic stones.
The stones were entrusted to his most faithful followers in order to purrevent the wand's power from falling into the wrong hands.
His most faithful followers, huh? Do you think that creature we fought on the Tombstone Trail could have been one of them...?
Now, now, concentrate! Purrepare yourself for the most important part of what I have to tell you!<NL>If my theory is correct...
...one of those followers—and the stone they were entrusted with—is in a cave beyond this village known as <color:#1>the Glittering Grotto</color>!
Bingo! That must be where the map of the stones was pointing us to!
Mmmyuh!? The map of the stones...?<NL>Y-You mean...?
You mean you knew purrecisely where it was already?<NL>So I haven't helped you at all...<NL>How inexpurressibly disappointing...
No! That's not true! We didn't know anything about the Wizard King, or his followers, or any of that stuff!<NL>Thank you, Purrofessor!
Purrofessor Tabitha...<NL>What kind of place is this Glittering Grotto?
...Well, as I mentioned, it's a cave just beyond Yule.<NL>A cave marked on ancient maps as "The Maw of<NL>the Mountain King."
My theory is that the Mountain King and the Wizard King are one and the same. Anyway, the cave has the power to suck objects into its darkest depths.
All of which leads me to theorize that one of the Wizard King's magic stones may well be hidden in the deepest part of the Grotto.
Uh-oh...I've got a funny feeling about this...
Yes, I'm sure you have, you great big wimp!<NL>It's called terror!
N-No it's not! Shut up!<NL>It's...intrepidness and, um...excitement...
Before you go rushing off in purrsuit of the stones, you'll need the purrmission of the village elder to enter the Glittering Grotto.
The village elder?
Purrecisely. But he's away at a gathering of the elders at the moment. You'll have to wait until tomorrow to<NL>meet him.
I was hoping to be able to accommodate you at my home, but I'm afraid there's not enough room there to swing<NL>a cat...
It's okay! You've done more than enough for us already! Thank you so much, Purrofessor Tabitha!
Don't be silly. It's me who should be thanking you! It's not every day you get to purrovide a renowned hero with help on his legendary quest!
There should be room for you all at the inn just inside the entrance to the village. I wish you a purrfectly wonderful night's rest!

Well, well... It is you—the famous Alicia.<NL>To what do I owe this...pleasure?

So you have come to do battle?<NL>How very unwise. And you a Great Sage...

You know that all magic is powerless in my presence.
Foolish girl... I have just the place for you.<NL>A prison of eternal darkness!

Crikey... Sounds like a proper stinker of a dream, Ollie-boy.
It was...<NL>Shadar was there...
And Mom... She was... She...<NL>Shadar, he...he...defeated her!<NL>A-And there was nothing I could do!
Calm down, Oliver!<NL>It was just a dream!
She's right, Ollie-boy. And anyway, it wasn't youer mam, was it? It was Alicia.
Alicia...<NL>Of course...
I guess it was, huh...<NL>Sorry, everybody...
...We will save her.<NL>We have to!
'Course we flipping do—it's the whole reason we're on this journey, en't it?
Yes. It is...
Great. Glad we've cleared that up.<NL>Can we go and see the village elder now?
Yeah, we'd best get going. Oh, I asked the nice lady who runs the inn, and she said his house is over by that <color:#1>big frozen pond</color> up the back of the village there.

Just look at it!<NL>It's so incredibly beautiful...
N-N-Not to mention incredibly c-cold. Brrr!<NL>And I thought it was n-n-n-nippy outside...
It is a b-b-bit brass m-m-m-monkeys, eh? Let's g-g-get this over with quick and get the f-f-f-flip out of here,<NL>shall we?
Gah, why do you two have to moan on and on like a pair of old codgers all the time?
B-B-Because we ARE a pair of old c-c-c-codgers compared to you! Brrrrrr!
It doesn't matter how cold it is. There's a <color:#1>magic stone</color> here, and we have to find it. We have to go on, no matter what. Watch your step, everybody...
P-P-P-Pah! That's easy for you to say, k-k-kiddo!<NL>I'd give my right nostril to be a littlie again...

evj0160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Who-o-oa!
Aaargh!
Phew!

evj0170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Mom!
Could this be the place?
It could. The Maw of the Mountain King seems an apt hiding place for the visionary magic of the ancients...
The power to save souls...<NL>Could it really be here?
If we could only find it, we might stand a chance of defeating the Dark Djinn.
Th-Th-That's my d-d-d—!<NL>I m-m-mean the old emperor!
It is, huh.<NL>Why would he and my mom be here?
That en't youer mam... That's the Great Sage Alicia...<NL>Crikey, it's been a while...
Alicia? Of course...<NL>She was in my dream...
She looks so much like her...
So the old emperor spent his time hanging around with pretty young sages, did he? Heh. It's all right for some...
Swaine! Is this really the time for your lewd comments?
No...<NL>She...disappeared...
What the hell was that?<NL>Am I seeing things?
Ahh, now I remember!<NL>Nah, mun! We en't seeing things!
We're not?
Oh, it was a tidy while back... Searching all over, she was—Alicia, I mean—for some ancient spell or other.
That must have been a conversation they had back then—can't have been anything else. Certain of it, I am!
Um...<NL>I don't quite understand...
What's not to understand? We just saw a flashback of the past. The only question is, why?
So that was the Great Sage Alicia...<NL>Mom's soul mate...
It won't be much longer now...<NL>We will save you, I promise!
Oliver...
Sorry, everybody.
Come on!<NL>Let's go get this stone!

evj0180_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Aaargh!
Haaa!

evj0200_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Stay back, everybody!<NL>It might still be dangerous!
Nah, mun. Look at those puppy dog eyes.<NL>He en't on the warpath no more.
Grrr... Forgive me...
Flipping heck, mun!<NL>A flipping talking dog!
Wh-What the hell are you!?
I am...Cerboreas, faithful servant of the Wizard King, and Keeper of the Stone.
So Tabitha was right...
Even after his passing, I served my master still.<NL>For many ages now have I guarded the stone...
But...its power became...too much for me...<NL>It consumed me... It drove me...insane...
You poor thing...
You came here for the stone, did you not?
Y-Yes, we did! We have to gather all of them so that we can defeat Shadar!
Hm. I had sensed that all was not right in the world beyond these walls...
In saving me from my madness, you have proven your strength and purity of heart. You are worthy of the stone.
You could tell all that just from us smacking you in the gob? Youer a perceptive pooch, I'll give you that.
Hm. I understand much that is not seen, fairy.
As will you. You are the ones for whom my master waited. For whom he waits still...
Your master...the Wizard King...he knows about us?
The Wizard King knows all. And the time when you, too, shall know all approaches.
But first, you must prove to him your strength.
Huh? How do we do that?
Do that which he asks of you. Grant him his final wish... Right the wrong of ages past...
What could the Wizard King want with us?
Beggared if I know. Still, looks like old Muttface didn't mean us any harm in the end, eh?
Maybe, but all he did was throw another load of riddles at us. When is this all going to start making sense?
Don't be so negative! We got the stone, and that's what matters! The thing to do now is to keep on going!
You're right, Esther!<NL>Time to go, everybody!

evk0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
This place has undergone some changes.
<KEEP>
Its Halcyon days seem far behind it.
...Halcyon? All that is left of that kingdom and its people is the empty citadel you see before you.
You have regrets? Destruction was the destiny those fools deserved. The choice you made was correct.
Well, well. I never thought I would hear you say that.
Now, Councillor...to what do I owe this pleasure?
I came to enquire about...your intentions.
...My intentions?
Your intentions for this world.
A world I believe you would protect.<NL>Am I not correct, Dark Djinn?
It is only a matter of time before<NL>the Forbidden Spell is used again.
Does the thought not seem...disagreeable to you?
We all share the same views of this world's pitiful denizens.
Their lives are no longer of the slightest value.
...I see. And you are quite sure of this?
My deeds shall demonstrate that I mean what I say.
Watch as the frail hopes of the people of this world<NL>are torn from them and turned to the blackest despair.
So you would have them share your fate?
...Very well.
Councillor...
Just what are your intentions?
This should be interesting!

evk0015_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
By the skies! You're swift, boy, I'll give you that! It seems you have yourselves a full set of magic stones already!
We couldn't have done it without Tengri!<NL>There's nowhere he can't fly!
Grahahahaharrr! He's done me proud! He may be a mere fledgling, but he has all the makings of a legendary dragon!
Now, you know what needs doing next, I take it? Those magic stones need to be reunited with that wand of yours.
So we just need to put the magic stones back in the holes in the wand, huh?
Okay! Here goes!
Arrr!
Hm?
Uh-oh...
Eh?
They'll never fit!
Flipping heck!<NL>What's all this about!?
They're the wrong blooming size, en't they?<NL>Are you blind or something?
I-I guess I didn't think to check...<NL>I mean, we were so busy looking for them...
You're not seriously telling me we've ended up with a bunch of worthless counterfeits, are you?
No. They're real, of that there can be no doubt. The Keepers of the Stones you crossed swords with were real enough, were they not?
Then why don't they fit the wand?
'Tis Mornstar that has changed size. Like as not, it's shifted shape to fit the hand of its new owner.
But there's bound to be a way to get those stones to follow suit, and I'll warrant some wise soul has scribbled it<NL>down somewhere.
I've a nose for plunder, and I'd say you'd best have a sniff round the selfsame place you first heard tell of Mornstar, and I first came by the map...
<color:#1>Hamelin</color>! Of course! You're right, Kublai!
So it's back to Hamelin again, is it? This seems to be becoming a habit. Come on then, Oliver.
Okay! Let's go see how Marcassin's doing!

evk0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hmmm. This is rather a tricky one...
Ohh, don't tell me you can't help us either!<NL>The stones are just too big, aren't they?
Well, if it were a mere matter of unifying the sizes of the wand and the stones, my powers would more than suffice.
But I am afraid it is not only their dimensions that are out of alignment. There is another problem... One that I lack the ability to resolve.
Hang on a minute! Are you telling us it en't just the wonky sizes we have to worry about!? It's never flipping easy, is it?
Ah, I think I've got it. Just think for a moment.<NL>When exactly did we get hold of Mornstar?
It was when we were sent back to the past.<NL>Which means... Ummm...
The problem may stem from attempting to join the Mornstar of fifteen years past with the stones you obtained here in the present.
As long as there is this...time difference, so to speak,<NL>it may not be possible to unite them.
So we need to find Mornstar here in the present....?
If only it were that simple. I had my men search for it, but it seems it has been destroyed. Not a trace of it remains in our time.
Hold on. We brought it with us from the past, so surely it makes sense that it doesn't exist in the present as well.
...Oh, yeah! Wait...what?
Hold on, hold on! This is all getting a bit too flipping complicated for me.
There may be one who can help you...
I speak of <color:#1>Khulan</color>. Of the four Great Sages, her magical powers were the most formidable.
So if we can find the Great Sage Khulan, she can help us with Mornstar.
We're talking about Khulan, the Queen of the Heavens, right? She ruled a city in the clouds called Xanadu.<NL>But that place—
Was destroyed, yes.
Jeepers! Her city was destroyed!?
Can it really be five years ago? Yes, it must be. Five years ago, news reached us that Shadar had attacked the celestial citadel of Xanadu...
By the time we mustered out forces, it was too late. When Hamelin's airborne divisions arrived, Xanadu had been wiped from the map.
I am afraid I do not know what became of its queen and her subjects. But perhaps...if you are lucky...
Bah. Fat chance. It sounds like Shadar dealt with them just like he dealt with your predecessor...
Swaine... P-Please...
...In any case, it is not within my power to help you.<NL>For that, I can only apologize.
Don't worry, Your Majesty!<NL>There must be another way!
Well, if we can't find Khulan, I guess we'll have to try another Great Sage.
Another? Well, Alicia is no longer with us, which leaves only Rashaad.
Yes! My father is sure to know something!
Your father? Ah, now I see where you get your wisdom! Yes, Rashaad may well be able to help you.
Ha ha! Thank you, Your Majesty!
Hmph. We're not going to find anything out by hanging around here swapping compliments. Let's be off, shall we?
Sure! Let's go find somebody who can help us. They're out there somewhere, I just know they are!

evk0030_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Gosh! Look at her!
That's not the type of armor you find round these parts. There's no snout, for starters.
Hm. There sure is something strange about her...
Hold on... Could she be...?
What is it, Swaine?<NL>Is she a friend of yours?
Heh. Yeah, we go way back...<NL>But seriously, it's that armor she's wearing...
It's what they wore in Xanadu.
You what!?
But I thought Xanadu was destroyed...
So she's a survivor, is she? There's lucky! Come on, Ollie-boy! Let's find out what ouer girl's got to say for herself!

evk0035_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Can it be?<NL>Can you...? Can you see me?
'Course we can.<NL>Why wouldn't we be able to?
Oh! This is marvelous!<NL>And you can hear me too!?
Sure we can hear you... But if we're using <color:#8>Spirit Medium</color> to speak to you, it must mean...
You are correct. I lost my life some time ago. And you are the first to notice my presence...
Well, we weren't going to miss you in that get-up, were we? So you came from Xanadu, did you?
...Indeed. The celestial kingdom of Xanadu was my home. I was charged with protecting our queen...
But Shadar destroyed Xanadu, didn't he?<NL>So I guess you...um...
No. I did not fall in battle.
I was... I was slain by a comrade...<NL>A fellow citizen of Xanadu.
Huh!? What do you mean!?
What you said was correct. Shadar did indeed lay waste to my home.
The fiend made his way into the inner sanctum of the palace, unnoticed by anyone.
Our magic had no effect on him. Even the mighty sorcery of Queen Khulan was useless.
Khulan... But we heard she had the most powerful magic of all the Great Sages...
Nonetheless, it was of no use. She too was powerless against him. But Shadar did not take our lives. No, he robbed us of something else...
He stole our hearts. He took the hearts of all who dwelled in our city.
He... He stole ALL of your hearts!?
Indeed. And without hearts to call our own, we lacked emotion...we lacked reason...
And that was how it came to pass that...
Duw! You've said enough! We can imagine what happened then, believe me...
...Shadar will pay for this!
What happened that day, I will never forget...<NL>Its horror is forever etched in my memory.
That's so horrible... To be killed by one of your own people... I... I'm so sorry.
Do not pity me.<NL>My people still have hope.
Hope? What do you mean?
Queen Khulan... The Queen of the Heavens...<NL>She lives still...
...Huh!?
She does!?<NL>But we thought that...
Now that I dwell in the spirit realm, I can feel her presence. I can sense my queen's power.
For years, I have searched for her without cease.<NL>But she is not to be found in this kingdom.
I sense her presence somewhere to the north of here.<NL>But I sense something else too... An evil so terrible, I fear to approach it.
North of here?<NL>Do you mean the Tombstone Trail?
Hmm...maybe. Time was, there were other kingdoms on this continent. Now there's only Hamelin, and the odd town or two.
But if she's out there, we have to find her.
We've got Tengri! If the Queen of the Heavens is somewhere around here, we're sure to find her.
Do you mean it? Do you really mean to search for her? You have my eternal gratitude.
Don't worry, ma'am! We won't let Shadar get away with what he's done!
And besides, we have our own scores to settle with the fiendish scoundrel...
Oh, stop trying to impress her by sounding all heroic! What he means to say is, leave it to us!
I thank you most humbly.<NL>I am deeply grateful.
Ah, I almost forgot! Should you find Queen Khulan, or any other survivor from Xanadu, would you give them this?
It was damaged by the fire that swept through our realm, but it is the only remaining proof that my city, and indeed myself, ever existed...
Sure! Leave it to us!
That's enough chitchat for now! It's time to scour <color:#1>Autumnia</color> and see if we can't find Queen Khulan!

evk0040_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Who goes there?<NL>Ah... I see you are not from these parts.
How very observant of you. Listen, we'd love to stay and chat, but we've got things to do...
This town has been blessed by a higher power. I cannot allow the likes of you to disturb the tranquility of such a sacred place.
Gee... Sorry, Mister. We didn't know.<NL>But we're not here to disturb anything.
Talk about a warm flipping welcome! This miserable<NL>so-and-so could do with some lessons in hospitality from my dear old mam.
Cease your senseless witterings!<NL>I will not let you pass.
Begone! I have important matters to attend to. The sacred ceremony is about to begin, and Queen Khulan will not be kept waiting!
...Hang on! Did you just say Queen Khulan!?<NL>It's her we're after!
Aha! Just as I thought! You intend to harm our queen! Well, you shall not do so while I draw breath!
No! You've got it all wrong, Mister!<NL>We just want to speak to her.
Somebody told us she was still alive.<NL>The person who gave us this medal...
B-But... How!? Tell me!<NL>Where did you find this?
W-We met a lady in Hamelin. She was wearing armor just like yours.
Can it be...? Is she here now?
No, she said she wouldn't travel north. I reckon she had enough on her plate already, what with her being dead and all...
But this... Can it be true?<NL>Can she really be gone...?
It seems our friend here and that mystery woman have some history...
I feared she had not escaped... But I cannot allow my feelings to come before my duty. Tell me, what business have you with the Queen?
There's something we need to ask her...
I see. Well, I will let you pass. But I am afraid you may be out of luck.
What? You mean we can't see Queen Khulan?
I fear she will have no time for you now. Did I not say that she is preparing to preside over the sacred ceremony?
For the time being, take a look around the town, and see how it has blossomed since receiving the blessing of the Queen of the Heavens.

evk0050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ai-ai-ai! That guard! What is he thinking?<NL>Why has he let in more outsiders? First, there was that giant man, and now...children?
Uh, excuse me, Ma'am. We're looking for Queen Khulan. The guard said she was somewhere around here.
Hm. So you have come to receive her blessing?
Here we go a-flipping-gain! What's all this about sacred ceremonies and blooming blessings?
¿Qué? You come to Perdida, yet you know nothing of blessings? Look deep into the eyes of the people here! See how we are blessed!
Oh, we've seen them all right!<NL>Those people aren't blessed, they're...
Brokenhearted. Seems like some blessings aren't worth counting...
¿Qué? What did the man say, yaya?<NL>Our hearts...they are broken?
Pay no attention, cariño. The blessings we have received have lifted the fear from our hearts.
Do you know how many towns in this land have been wiped from the map by the Dark Djinn?
But you can't just give in! You have to stand up to Shadar!
...Let me take a look at you, niño.<NL>Ah, you are a wizard, are you not?
How can you know what it is to have no magic, no power, nothing but fear in your heart?
B-But, Ma'am... You can't let your heart be broken just because it stops you feeling afraid!
He's right! What's the point of a blessing like that? <NL>You may as well have your heart broken by Shadar!
Hmph. Nina, cariño...it is nearly time for the ceremony to begin.
It is finally time for you to join us.<NL>It is time for you to be blessed.
I-I am ready, yaya!
Then let us go. We must not keep Queen Khulan waiting.
I'm not so sure Queen Khulan's going to be much help, you know...
Not if she's the one handing out these so-called "blessings"...
But if we don't do something, that little girl will end up like everybody else. We have to go after them!

evk0060_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
There, there, Nina. It will be over soon.<NL>There's a good girl, cariño...
<KEEP>
Yaya!
May we begin the ceremony?
Everything is in order, Queen Khulan.
It's her!
The Queen of the Heavens!
We found Khulan!
I've got a bad feeling about this...
Get a load of her eyes, will you?<NL>They're all weird!
Jeepers! She's brokenhearted!
Shadar must have done this when he attacked Xanadu!
So now we know why she's been up to no good, handing out those so-called "blessings."
But if we don't do something, Nina will end up brokenhearted too.
No! Let me go!
What is the matter, my child?
I don't want to be blessed!<NL>I don't need it!
I don't want to be brokenhearted!<NL>Everyone is wrong!
Nina! How dare you say such things in the presence of Queen Khulan!?
...The child refuses my blessing?
...Then she leaves me no choice. For the benefit of this misguided girl, a special ceremony is required...
Wh-What do you mean to do to her!?
Wh-What's happening?
That's not good.
It's a flipping Nightmare!<NL>What's it going to do with the pooer dab?
Nina's in danger!
Right!
We've got to save her!
Come on, everybody!

evk0070_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Yaya!
Nina, cariño...
Are you all right?
Your Highness!
Get away from me!
(gasp)
You disappoint me, Queen of the Heavens!
Lord Shadar...!
Shadar!
Where is he?
... (breathless gasp)
Hear me, Queen of the Heavens.
The power of your Nightmare...
...is as good as spent.
Though you are a sage, it would seem you are all too human.
Perhaps I was wrong to choose you as my representative...
Lord Shadar! I beg you!<NL>Give me one more—!
<KEEP>
It is too late!
Shorn of the power of your Nightmare,<NL>what use have I for one such as you?
Queen Khulan!
Kublai!
Ha! Sorry to keep you waiting!
But how?
I see! The dregs of Xanadu arrive!<NL>How amusing!
I look forward to seeing how much of<NL>a fight you put up this time...
Do you think Queen Khulan is back to her old self again?
Kublai! ...How dare you!? That a baseborn ruffian like you should presume to meddle in the affairs of a queen!
Grahaharrr! My apologies, Your Highness!<NL>I never did know my place, did I?
And the same goes for the rest of you! What business can your unruly kind have with one such as I?
Charming, isn't she? It looks like the Queen of the Heavens is still very much brokenhearted.
This looks like a job for you, lad!<NL>Can you do for the Queen what you did for Tengri?
Sure I c-can! I can mend her broken heart.
There's no doubt about it. What Her High-and-Mightiness is missing is a spot of <color:#1>love</color>. And that's what makes the world go round, en't it?
So it's <color:#1>love</color> she needs, is it? Who do we know that's brimming with love?
If it's <color:#1>love</color> you're after, I'm your man.
You what?
You heard me! No man has more <color:#1>love</color> for a woman than I have for Khulan!
You l-love Queen Khulan!?
Never!
Ha ha ha! He loves her! He loves her!<NL>Now we know! Now we know!<NL>...Ahem.
Enough of this nauseating talk of love!<NL>The very word turns my stomach!
Grahahahaharrr! Thus speaks the fiery maiden I fell for! 'Tis music to my ears!
Crikey! It must be love if he's happy taking that kind of abuse on the chin!
Yes! What's the story between Kublai and Queen Khulan? I need to know!
Calm down, will you?
Never mind that now! All we need to know is that Kublai has to share some of the <color:#1>love</color> in his heart with<NL>Queen Khulan!
Grahahahaharrr! Quite so! Have at it, lad!

evk0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...Kublai?
Your Highness! So you are back with us!
I spoke so harshly to you just now. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?
Grahahahaharrr! Think nothing of it! 'Twas a pleasure to hear such rough and ready words from the mouth of a noble-born lady!
Pray do not mock me, Kublai...
I'm just glad Queen Khulan's not brokenhearted anymore!
Too right! And I must say I'm impressed with old Pirateface by here! That's two servings of his heart we've helped ouerselves to now!
Ha! You're right! It seems as if his love for the Queen is a little bit special.
...You call me "Queen"?<NL>I am unworthy of such a title.
The skyborne kingdom of Xanadu was torn from the heavens and cast into the distant ocean... I could not protect my realm.
And then I came to this town and broke the hearts of its people. Truly, I am no queen...
But Your Highness...<NL>You shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
Listen to me! The people of Xanadu saw you as a wise and just ruler.
You carried out your duties both as a queen and a sage, and trained countless wizards. Have you forgotten all the good you've done?
Kublai... What you say may be true, but it does not excuse the harm I have caused. I have inflicted so much suffering...
Your Highness, we met the ghost of a lady in Hamelin—<NL>a soldier who once served you...
She was one of the people who died in Xanadu...
And she told us that so long as Queen Khulan was alive, there was hope for her people.
She spoke of me...?<NL>She spoke of hope...?
And look around you! The people of this town may be brokenhearted, but at least they're alive!
Your Highness, let us return this town to its former self.<NL>It may take time, but I know you can do it...
You may not be a queen any longer, but we still stand beside you. You are not alone. And who's to say you can't rebuild Xanadu?
Oh Kublai... Thank you...<NL>Thank you, everyone.
You are right!
I cannot give in to despair. I must become someone who can inspire hope in others. That is my duty!
You aren't the only Great Sage who was led astray!<NL>My father and Marcassin suffered too!
Yes, and Oliver here helped them just like he helped you. And now you're all fighting fit, the battle against evil can finally begin in earnest!
Wait a minute! There's something I've been dying to ask!
I need to know how long something's been going on between Queen Khulan and Kublai! I mean, a queen and a sky pirate... It's...so romantic!
Gah... Do you have to be so nosy?
Kublai is known and feared as the King of the Sky Pirates—but there is more to him than meets the eye...
Graharrr! Quite right! I'm a man of many talents, and being the fearless leader of a band of swashbuckling sky pirates is just one of them!
Kublai also served as the commander of the Xanaduvian Airborne Division, in which role he fought for<NL>Queen Khulan.
Avast! I can speak for myself, you slack-jawed cur!
You were a commander in Xanadu?
Indeed he was. Since the time of the Wizard Wars, Xanadu has avoided conflict.
But neutrality cannot be maintained without significant military power. Kublai's forces formed part of that power.
Oh, I get it! The lowly servant who ended up falling head over heels in love with the Queen... That's a classic!
SWAINE!<NL>Do you always have to be so blunt!?
Arr, but it's true. I've watched over her since she was but a girl. And I can't say I don't feel for her... But I am a mere soldier, and there's naught can be done about that...
Gee... That must be tough...
But that was then. Things have changed.
Changed? Changed how, exactly?
Did you not hear my words earlier? I am a queen no longer. There are no ranks or barriers to keep us apart.
C-Can it be? Do you truly mean...?
...I have been quite clear.<NL>Please do not make me spell it out.
I...uh...<NL>I...
Come on, Kublai! Don't be so slow!
Flipping heck, mun! Put us out of ouer misery, won't you? How many times are you going to make the pooer woman say it?
Still your chattering tongues or I'll cut them off!<NL>Y-You stand before the King of the Sky Pirates!
...Gah! All right, all right!!!

evk0085_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
The hearts of the people of Perdida have<NL>been restored.
Young Nina, you must have been terribly afraid.<NL>I apologize most humbly for my actions.
Do not worry, Queen Khulan! I am happy that you have become so kind and gentle!
Everything in Perdida, it is so bright and happy now.<NL>We will never give in to Shadar!
Your words are music to my ears. Truly, children like you are the bearers of hope, the hope of a brighter future.
We who are old enough to know better chose the path of cowardice. All we wanted was to be free of fear, to be protected from the truth...
Well, what's done is done, and all that! I just hope that rotter Shadar's not still hanging about, waiting to pounce, like.
I know what I must do. My duty is to protect the people of Perdida from Shadar.
I vow never to let his dark despair engulf this town again. I will make amends for all I have done.
Gracias, Your Highness!
Then it seems I've no choice! I'll throw my lot in with you, Your Highness! We'll protect this puny village together!
No, Kublai. There are other duties to which you<NL>must attend.
It is not only this town that must be protected from the dark pall of Shadar's despair.
With your airship, you may travel freely around our world... Do you understand what it is that I ask of you?
Ah...I do, at that. Only too well.
No! But you only just got together!
Kublai, though we may be apart, we will always be together, as long as we share the same goal.
Grahahahaharrr! You're not wrong, Your Highness!<NL>You always did have a way with words!
Looks like everything's worked out, then.<NL>...Oh, but before I forget, there was a reason we came here, to the middle of nowhere.
I am aware of this.<NL>It concerns Mornstar, does it not?
Yes. We're trying to restore its power. We did manage to find the three magic stones, but even Marcassin couldn't reunite them with the wand.
It was beyond Marcassin's powers, you say?<NL>How could that be? Tell me more...
Well, he speculated that it might be because we brought Mornstar here from the past...
Hmmm... A masked wizard who can manipulate time itself. I am most curious as to what his intentions could be...
But I shall ponder that at my leisure. Our priority is to put a stop to Shadar's plans. I will perform the required ritual without delay...
Tidy! Sounds like old Khulan knows what needs doing to get Mornstar back in one piece, eh? There's handy!
Now, young Oliver, I shall require some assistance in this undertaking. Are you willing to help me?
Sure, Queen Khulan! Just tell me what I have to do!
A fine response! The ritual must be performed outside.<NL>When you are ready, come and see me.<NL>I shall be waiting.

evk0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oliver, do you know of a spell named <color:#8>Rejuvenate</color>?
Sure, I do! It turns back the clock for objects, to before they were old or broken.
Well, it is the memory retained within objects that is being revived. Only the spell <color:#8>Breach Time</color> allows time itself to be manipulated.
Now, I believe that <color:#8>Rejuvenate</color> should be able to restore the magic stones to the state they were in fifteen years ago.
Ohh, I get it! That way, they'll be the same as Mornstar from fifteen years ago, huh?
Indeed. I will need to combine the spell <color:#8>Rejuvenate</color> with the ritual required to reunite the stones with Mornstar.
Flipping heck! Wouldn't that be a bit of a stretch, even for you, Youer Heavenliness?
It will not be easy, and I understand why Marcassin balked at the challenge. But I believe that I can do this for you...
Thank you, Your Highness!
Now, without further ado, let the ritual commence.
Hm!
(four gasps as gems fly into wand and it glows)
Wow!
The ritual is complete. What you now hold is Mornstar in its true form.
Please consult your Wizard's Companion. The wand's power has restored new pages, with new spells for you to use.
Jeepers! These spells look so...neat!
The spell known as <color:#8>Unleash</color> will prove very useful to you, I am certain.
Doubtless, you have done battle with those creatures known as guardians, whose poor hearts had been broken by Shadar.
When you defeated them, you received certain gemstones, did you not?
That's right! They dropped them big jewels, en't it, Ollie-boy?
These gems are symbols of the guardians' gratitude, and contain a part of their spirit and life force.
Jeepers!
By using <color:#8>Unleash</color>, you can channel the energies which reside in the gems, and call upon the guardians' strength in battle.
With their power at your command, you will be able to hold your own even against Shadar.
Th-Thank you, Your Highness! That sounds like it'll come in real handy!
Heh heh! That doesn't sound too shabby, does it, Oliver? Shadar'll be quaking in his boots!
You are now better equipped to face Shadar in battle,<NL>but a serious obstacle stands between you and any such encounter.
Oh, here we flipping go.<NL>What is it this time?
Shadar dwells within the castle of <color:#1>Nevermore</color>. It lies to the north of here, beyond the <color:#1>Miasma Marshes</color>.
Should a careless traveler be engulfed by the dark miasma for which the marshes are known, they will be lost forever.
Wait a second! The Miasma Marshes?<NL>I-I...
What is it, Esther? Have you heard of them?
It's something my father once spoke of. He told me of a mist that was so dark that no light could penetrate it—<NL>the miasma.
He said that the only way to clear it was with the call of the <color:#1>Clarion</color>.
The Clarion! I remember you saying that we'd be the ones to play it again, Esther!
Yes! The Clarion is a symbol of peace that was created by the three kings of this world. Now, what was the rhyme...?
"In Ding Dong Dell they carve full well that old Mamooni wood, and bear it then to Hamelin, to make it sound so good!"
I am impressed by your knowledge, Esther.<NL>But then, you are the daughter of a Great Sage.
Oh, it's just a rhyme I learned when I was little...
So if we give this Clarion a good honk, it'll clear us a path across the Miasma Marshes, will it?
That is correct. And the first thing you require to make the Clarion is the <color:#1>holy wood</color>.
"...that old <color:#1>Mamooni wood</color>..."<NL>I think it's time we paid the Cowlipha a visit!

evk0100_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It's nice to see you again, Your Moojesty.
I say! You have returned! Now, tell me, boy, have you located that handsome young man in the picture we so generously gave you?
Yes, we found him, Your Moojesty! And now Prince Marcassin's back to his old self.
That picture of youers came in proper useful in the end, Youer Moojesty. Even if you did only have it cos you had a crush on the pooer lad...
Hm hm hm!<NL>We are most pleased to hear that you accomplished your aims. But what brings you back to us, pray tell?
Umm... Your Moojesty, have you heard of the <color:#1>Clarion</color>?
Indeed we have! Are we to take it that you require the aforementioned instrument? Is the time finally at hand?
That's right, Your Moojesty!<NL>We need it to cross the Miasma Marshes.
Abull! You heard the young man!<NL>Fetch you-know-what this instant!
Y-Yes, Most Bountiful Bovinity...
I present to you the holy wood!
<KEEP>
Hm hm hm! Guard that wood with your lives, won't you now? Who can say how long it will take for another branch like that to grow.
Gee! Thanks, Your Moojesty!<NL>This means we can do battle with Shadar!
So you really do intend to face him? Tell us, are you familiar with the events of the Wizard Wars?
Yes, Your Moojesty. I heard something about them.<NL>The whole world was at war, wasn't it?
It was a most protracted and bloody affair. And at the end of it, only three kingdoms remained: Al Mamoon, Ding Dong Dell, and Hamelin.
The three ruling families vowed then to keep the peace, and the Clarion served to symbolize their sacred pledge.
But when the shadow of the Dark Djinn fell across the world, our three kingdoms were driven into a simply frightful series of disputes.
In retrospect, it is most unfortunate that we did not join forces and make a new Clarion back then...
Join forces, Your Moojesty?
That's right, boy. Now, if we recall correctly, you have already visited each of the three kingdoms...
That's right, Youer Moojesty! We're close personal friends with the big...erm...cheeses in every kingdom!
Hm hm hm! It amuses us to think that a dear little boy should be the one to mend the bridges between<NL>our kingdoms.
Uh...thanks, Your Moojesty.
Yes, thanks, Your Moojesty! We'd love to stay and chat, but this Clarion won't make itself! Shall we head over to the next kingdom?
Yes! It's time to go to <color:#1>Ding Dong Dell</color> and see King Tom!

evk0200_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So, off to see the Cat King, is it? Ah, this place really takes me back.
It was the first town we visited together, wasn't it?
Listen, I'm sure you're enjoying your trip down memory lane, but haven't we got business to be taking care of?
I hate to say it, but Swaine's right. We need to complete the Clarion, and that means getting this <color:#1>holy wood</color>—
...Huh!? B-But...how!?
What's the matter? Don't tell me you've gone and dropped the flipping thing!
N-No... I didn't drop it. I mean, I had it just a second ago. I'm sure I did...
So you're saying someone made off with it while you weren't looking?
Well, you'd know a thing or two about that, wouldn't you?
There you go, bringing up ancient history again!<NL>Look, you're the one who lost it. Don't go blaming me!
I had it all this time, I swear!
Stop fighting, both of you! If it's missing, we have to find it, and fast!
Youer not wrong, Ollie-boy! Let's ask some of the folks round by here if they've seen it.

evk0210_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oi, you little pipsqueak! You're the one who tried to make a quick guilder selling the <color:#1>holy wood</color>, aren't you?
Squeeeak! How'd you find me? Er...I-I'll never do it again! Honest! Never, ever, or my name's not Pip!
Pip? But why? What made you start stealing?
I needed the money, didn't I? Not that it's any of your blinking business! How am I going to make my dreams come true if I'm broke, eh?
Your dreams? That's no excuse for stealing!<NL>What kind of dreams do you have, anyway?
Nice try, dumb-dumb! You think I'm telling you? I know you'll just laugh at me for being a silly little mouse with big ideas!
Crikey! Bit blooming touchy, en't we? There's no need to be so flipping defensive, Mouseface!
Well, we did just corner him, to be fair. Anyway, let's collar the little runt and head back to the Cawtermaster's Store, shall we?
...Wait a second, you guys. Is it just me, or does Pip really remind you of somebody?
Hm? You mean he might share a soul with someone back in Motorville?
I think so... But I'm just not sure who it could be.
Um, Pip. Would you mind telling us a little more about your dream? We won't laugh at you, I promise.
Why should I!? You can't tell me what to do! Why should I take orders from a big baby who sleeps with a stupid doll?
...What!?<NL>Is that true, Oliver!?
N-No! I don't sleep with a doll...anymore.
Ha ha! How grown-up of you! But I bet you still drag it around with you everywhere in case you get scared at night—you big baby!
I DO NOT! I told you, I don't sleep with a doll anymore!<NL>I stopped taking Mr. Drippy to bed almost a year ag—
Oh.
HA HA HA! Now you've done it, dumb-dumb! You all heard him, didn't you? I bet your girlfriend's really impressed now!
Stop being mean! She's not my— A-And I don't sleep with a doll! Cut it out, will you!?
Just cut it out, Phil!
Eh? Did you just call him "Phil"?<NL>That mangy mouse's name is Pip!
I-I'm sorry. It's just...what he said—it sounded just like Phil when he's being mean.
Blimey! Well, you know what that means...
I don't know what you're on about!<NL>All I know is you'll never catch me!
This rotten rodent is starting to get on my nerves...
He's not making things easy for us, is he? What are we going to do, Oliver?
Well...It took me a while to work it out,<NL>but there's no mistake...
He can be kinda mean...and real stubborn...but he's still my best friend. I'm talking about Phil.
Tidy! I think we've got ouer man! Just goes to show, if you've got a big bully for a soul mate, you might just turn out to be a nasty piece of work, too...
Hm. I get it. Something must be going on with his soul mate to have made this mouse turn to a life of crime.
I feel kinda bad. It's been a while since I saw Phil.<NL>I hope he's okay...
Let's go and see <color:#1>Philip in Motorville</color>! Come on, Oliver! There's no time to waste!

evk0240_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Phil!

evk0250_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Phil!
Gah!<NL>All of it... It's all my fault...
Flipping heck! The pooer lad's still brokenhearted!
You must really hate me, Ollie.
I guess we're not friends anymore, huh?
No! I-I never said that!
It should've been me...<NL>It should've been me in that car...<NL>It should've been me in the river...
That way, your mom would've never had to save you... That way, she'd still be alive!
You can't think like that, Phil! It won't change anything.
What was I thinking, trying to build a car...? If I hadn't built that hunka junk, none of this would've ever happened!
Phil, this isn't what my mom would have wanted!<NL>She wouldn't want to see you like this!
We were trying to make our dreams come true.<NL>We were trying to make the neatest car in the<NL>whole world, remember?
...Our dreams?
Gah! Who cares about our dumb dreams!
B-But...!
Didn't you listen to a word I said? Your mom's DEAD because of our dumb dreams!
So what do I do now? Build another car? Mess it up again? Get somebody else— Get them— I-I can't...
...Listen to me, Phil.
My mom would never want us to give up on our dreams.<NL>I just know it.
You remember all those times we'd sneak into the car factory? Remember the old guy we made friends with there, the engineer?
He told us all about cars, didn't he? And we promised him we'd make a car better than anything Motorville had<NL>ever seen!
Sure, my mom used to tell us we had cars on the brain.<NL>But when she heard us talk about our dream...
She'd smile.<NL>She never really got mad at us, did she?
I remember...
She wanted us to follow our dreams.<NL>I know she did.
Follow...our dreams...
I know it's what my mom would have wanted.
You can't give up on your dreams!
Huh?
Well, I never! I didn't see this one coming, Ollie-boy!<NL>It's youer own heart that's making the Locket glow!
Youer heart's brimming with <color:#1>ambition</color>! I should've known!
But... But what am I supposed to do?<NL>...Can I really take a piece of my own heart?
Well, it can't hurt to try now, can it? And it'll make a change from borrowing from other folks! Go on, mun—give it a go!
O-Okay... Here goes...

evk0260_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Jeepers creepers! That sure felt strange. I guess that must be how all the people who helped us felt, huh?
Nice one, Ollie-boy!<NL>I told you it was worth a try, didn't I!
Hold on, Phil! There's something I need to share with you...

evk0265_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I don't know what's wrong with me, Ollie. I just can't...
I just can't stop crying...<NL>But I feel all warm and fuzzy too...
You know what that is, Phil? That's my mom trying to tell you something.
She's telling you to never give up on your dreams.
...Never give up?
That's right. And we don't want to let my mom down, do we? So that means we have to keep on going—keep on chasing after our dreams!
I-I can't let my mom down. I won't!
You're right, Ollie! I won't give up!
I won't give up on my dreams!<NL>...On our dreams!
And that's a promise, Ollie!
Phil!
Ollie!
I'm going to study hard, and go to college! Then I'm going to build a car that's safe, a car people can rely on. You see if I don't!
You'll hold me to that, won't you, Ollie?
Sure I will, Phil!
Now, there's one other thing I gotta tell you, Ollie: if you're gonna keep dressing like a weirdo, I can't be seen with you!
Wh— Oh! These clothes...I... Uhh...<NL>It's not what you think!
Nah, it's okay really. If you wanna dress like a crazy, who am I to stop you? Now, I got important things to do! See you around, kiddo!
To tell you the truth, Ollie-boy, I didn't know if nabbing a nugget of youer own heart was going to work.
Well, it looks like it worked fine, Mr. Drippy.<NL>Phil's back to his old self.
I've been waiting for ages...<NL>Where is he?
Oh!
H-Huh!?
Eh? What's wrong with him all of a sudden?
Oliver! I've been waiting!<NL>Where were you?
Pea! What are you doing here?<NL>This is my house!
Pea? You mean Pea's here right now?
Yes, she came right out of my house.<NL>But how did you get inside?
Easy-peasy! I can open any door I like!
Uh, listen, Pea—I'm not sure I understand.<NL>Who were you waiting for?
You, silly!<NL>I've got something to tell you.
Oliver, are you sure you'll be all right?<NL>Whatever happens?
Even if you find out the truth?
The...the truth?
I'm worried about you, Oliver.<NL>Are you sure you'll be all right?
Well, I'm not exactly sure what it is you're worried about, Pea...
But as long as my friends are with me, I'll be fine.<NL>You don't have to worry about me.
Good!
Oh! Oliver!
What is it?
I'll always watch over you!
Okay?
Th-Thanks...
So what did Pea have to say, Oliver?<NL>We only heard what you said...
She said she was worried about me. So I told her that I had my friends with me, and that I was going to be okay.
'Course you are, Ollie-boy! You've got the Lord High Lord of the Fairies on youer side, en't it?
Heh. And don't forget me! We've been through a fair few scrapes, but we're still going strong, aren't we?
Ha! As if he'd forget you, Swaine!
Thanks, you guys. That means a lot.<NL>Now, Phil's back to his old self, so let's go see Pip.
Right! Back we go to <color:#1>Ding Dong Dell</color>!

evk0268_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ah, you're back, I see.
And we've caught ourselves a thief.<NL>Come on, pipsqueak! Out with it!
This piece of wood! It was me!<NL>I stole it!
You stole it? A little chap like you?
He confessed, didn't he? That mouse stole it and sold it to you, the rotter.
I haven't spent any of the money, I promise.<NL>I'll give it all back to you.
Well, I sense this is an item of some value to you, and that its loss has cawsed you some distress. I hate to see it go, but I know where it belongs.
Well, that's that sorted then. We're lucky the shopkeeper wasn't in the mood to rook us.
You know, Pip, I can't believe you turned yourself in and returned the money. And you call yourself a thief!?
I-I'm no thief, I'm telling you! It was just a moment of madness. I'm so, so sorry.
I'll do anything to make it up to you!<NL>I mean it!
Listen, it's okay. We got it back in the end.
Oh, I almost forgot. You said that your dreams had driven you to become a thief...
That's right. I've got big dreams, but they don't come cheap. I need guilders, and lots of them.
Have you ever heard of something called a<NL>Cloud Sweeper?
Isn't that a sort of flying broom powered by magic?<NL>Not my kind of thing...
Well it's my kind of thing, that's for sure... Ever since I was little, I've always wanted to build my very own Cloud Sweeper.
I want to build the fastest, bestest Cloud Sweeper in the whole world!
Is it just me, or does he really remind you of someone?
He sure does! Say, Pip—building something that goes real fast is super neat, huh?
Ha! Finally someone who understands me!
Thanks for taking the time to hear me talk about my dreams. Now, I need to save up some money...<NL>the honest way.
Good luck, Pip!

evk0270_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It's good to see you again, Your Meowjesty.
Mmm? Ah, you have returned! How the devil have you been? One has been busying oneself with that rogue<NL>Hickory Di— Mmyoh!
Myahhh! Unless one is very much mistaken, you come bearing the <color:#1>holy wood</color> of Al Mamoon.
That's right. And we wanted to ask a favor of you,<NL>Your Meowjesty—
No need to continue, dear girl. One knows precisely why you are here. So the Cowlipha chose to entrust the holy wood to you...
It seems the time has come to reunite the power of the three kingdoms.
Now, dear boy, allow one to do one's royal duty...
Wow! That was amazing!
Mmmyuh? Well, surely you expected nothing less?
Thank you, Your Meowjesty! It sure has been great seeing you, but we have to head to Hamelin now!
So Marcassin's up next. Here's hoping he's been practicing his carpentry...
Why are you mumbling to yourself, Swaine?
So you're off to <color:#1>Hamelin</color>, mmm? Take care, won't you?<NL>It's a rather grubby place for one so very pure!

evk0280_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hello, Marcassin!<NL>We need you to finish carving something for us!
Flipping heck! Someone didn't go to finishing school! Heard of the word "please," have you?
Ha! I do enjoy your visits. There is a certain liveliness you bring to every occasion. Now, you mentioned carving something?
Yes, Your Majesty. Esther was talking about the <color:#1>Clarion</color>.
That's right! We need you to help us finish it so we can clear a path across the Miasma Marshes!
Ah, I see. Well, you have come to the right place... The <color:#1>Clarion</color> may only be completed by the ruler of Hamelin...
But I am afraid there is a minor problem...<NL>Namely that he does not possess all of the skills required...
Huh?<NL>H-How do you mean, Your Majesty?
To complete the <color:#1>Clarion</color>, one must possess not only magical power, but the talent to carve the necessary holes.
While I may have the magical skills, I am unable to help with the more...practical aspects of the process...
So you're saying you're too clumsy to complete<NL>the Clarion?
I-It is not a matter of clumsiness, I assure you.<NL>No, the skills that are required are passed from the Emperor directly to his heir...
Gee... So your father passed away before he could teach you about this stuff, huh?
...Well then, we'll just have to go back in time and get him to teach you!
Blinking heck! You make it sound so flipping easy! You only get to use <color:#8>Breach Time</color> once in a lifetime, remember!
Ah, you're right...<NL>Well then, what do we do?
Aren't you forgetting someone?
Swaine? Do you mean...?
Truly? Did he...?
Well, I can't promise miracles. But Father did teach me a few things, yeah.
Ah yes, your father... Did he, um...come from this kingdom too? ...Only you never mentioned!
Gah! All right, all right!<NL>I just didn't want to make a big deal of it!
Yes, Marcassin's my brother and my real name's Gascon. There, I've said it.
...Oh, that? We knew that already.<NL>We were there, you know...
Then why are you so hell-bent on getting me to admit it!?
...Anyway, we can discuss the whys and wherefores later on. The point is, my father taught me what I need to know.
And youer telling us this now!? If you'd let us know a bit earlier, we wouldn't have had to come all the way to Hamelin, would we?
Hm. I'm afraid it's not that simple.<NL>I can't do the magic part, you see...
Flipping heck! So youer no use to us either, is it?
That is not quite true...
Ahh, so you know what I'm getting at, do you? I suppose it's not all bad having a brainbox of a Great Sage for<NL>a brother...
Uhh, I'm not sure I understand...
What cannot be done alone may yet be done together.<NL>Is that not so, Brother?
Ohhh, I get it! You're going to make it together!
Exactly. Now give it here.
Are you ready, Marcassin? We've got work to do.
Yes, Brother. I am ready.
Wow! That thing sure seems powerful...
<KEEP>
Yes! And they work so well together!
Now we can finally clear a path to Shadar's castle.<NL>Thank you, Your Majesty. And thank you too, Swaine!
Oh, don't worry about thanking me... But how long is it since we last made something together, Marcassin?
Ha! Do you remember the model pig tank we<NL>made together?
Bleurgh! A blooming pig tank!? That's the last pigging thing I want to be reminded of!
Heh. You'll hear no arguments from me on that score. Anyway, let's focus on the task ahead—clearing the Miasma Marshes.
The Clarion looks so beautiful...<NL>I can't wait to hear how it sounds!
I think you should be the one to play it, Esther.
Yeah, Ollie-boy's right. If you ask me, there en't no better woman for the job!
I agree. I mean, I'd love to do it, but I'm tone deaf.
I-I'll do it! I'll play the Clarion and clear a path through the Miasma Marshes!
I truly believe you will, Esther.
Thank you, Your Majesty!<NL>Come on, Oliver! We should get going!
You're right. It's time to head to the <color:#1>Miasma Marshes</color>.

evk0290_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So this is it, huh? The Miasma Marshes...
It en't the most welcoming place in the world, is it,<NL>Ollie-boy? I can hardly see the light from my own<NL>flipping lantern!
Well, here goes...
Ahh... I hear it...
<KEEP>
The call of the Clarion...
Oliver... How long have I waited?
Come, Vileheart.
Yes, Master!
I entrusted you with the truth, did I not?
Yes, Master. I have it here—in the Soulsnare.
The Clarion has sounded. The miasma is no more.
Is this not the perfect moment to...make things clear?
Indeed it is, Master!
Show it to him!
Show him how cruel the truth can be!
Your wish is my command!
"The one who heals the brokenhearted..."
"The savior of this world of sadness..."
Are you really the one?
Well, then! Show me!<NL>Show me the true power that dwells in your heart!

Ah, I hear it.
The call of the Clarion.
Oliver... How long have I waited?
Come, Vileheart.
Yes, Master!
I entrusted you with the truth,

Yes, Master. I have it here—in the Soulsnare.
The Clarion has sounded. The miasma is no more.

The Miasma Marshes...
Now we can cross them.
He's up ahead, en't he?
Yes. He's waiting.<NL>Shadar...

evk0300_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Well, I've seen some grim old places in my time,<NL>but this here takes the blooming biscuit!
I can feel him. He's not far now...<NL>Shadar...
Heh heh heh!<NL>Heh heh heh heh heh!
Heh heh heh!<NL>How long have I waited for you?
Shadar's cackling sidekick, I presume?
Heh heh heh! How observant of you! Yes!<NL>I am Vileheart! Lord Shadar is indeed my master!<NL>And it was he who entrusted me with this...
...The Soulsnare!
The Soulsnare!<NL>Alicia is in there!
That's right, Ollie-boy!<NL>And if we can just get her out of there—
Then my mom will come back!
Heh heh heh! There speaks a boy who hungers<NL>for the truth!
Vileheart! Let Alicia go!
Heh heh heh! Are you sure you are ready?
Huh? What do you mean?
Heh heh heh! You'll see...
Boo!<NL>Yah hah hah hah!

evk0310_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You did it, Ollie-boy!<NL>
Now we can set Alicia free!
Yes!
And bring your mother back!
Mom...
This is it, Oliver—your big moment.
<KEEP>
Right!
Heh heh!
Ha ha ha!

Wow!<NL>Huh? Aaah!

Wh-Where am I?
Mr. Drippy!<NL>Esther! ...Swaine!?
What is this place?

evk0330_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
That...<NL>That's Shadar!
Wait! I've been here before.<NL>In that dream I had!
It is time you met your end...Great Sage.
You are wrong, Shadar!<NL>I have found another way to defeat you!
...What?
I will travel to another world.
Somewhere out there, in a parallel dimension, there exists one who shares your soul.
If I can save this soul mate of yours, then you too will be—
Hm hm hm hm hm!<NL>So this is your plan? Your grand design?
Then I am afraid I must disappoint you.<NL>You see...I have no soul mate.
N-No... No, that's not possible!<NL>Without a soul mate...how could you exist?
I took the precaution of severing all ties with he who shared my soul, so that this weakness could not be used against me.
This cannot be!
Hm hm hm hm hm!<NL>You see now that every path is closed to you.<NL>Every path...save that which leads to death.
...No. Another yet remains.
Souls are reborn after a time...
...What do you mean by this?
Though you robbed him of life, he will be born again...
Perhaps many years hence...but he shall be reborn!
Madness...<NL>You cannot speak in earnest!
Surely not?<NL>
You know you will never return!<NL>Not to this time...
<KEEP>
I am well aware of that.
I am ready.
Damn you!
Today, tomorrow, yesterday!
(gasp)
That was Breach Time...<NL>That means Alicia traveled to the past...
No. You are mistaken.<NL>Alicia traveled forward in time.
I-I don't get it!<NL>What does this all mean!?
The truth still eludes you, boy? That which was captured in the Soulsnare was not Alicia's soul.
It was but her memory.
The memory of a battle we fought many years ago...
But where is Alicia now?
Hm hm hm hm hm!<NL>You know that better than I...
Huh?
I'm from...
...somewhere far away.
I'm going to take care of you, sweetie.
You'll be okay, I know you will...
Be good now...
...for me.
Mom!?<NL>What does my mom have to do with this?
You disappoint me, Oliver.<NL>This is Alicia's memory.
It was she who traveled to the future.<NL>It was she who escaped to your world.<NL>And it was she who gave birth to the savior of this world.
You mean...<NL>You mean Alicia was...
Yes. The Great Sage Alicia...was your mother.
Poor Allie.
B-But— But if my mom is from this world...<NL>where's her soul mate!?
Hm hm hm!<NL>She has no soul mate, in that world or this.<NL>...This is the price she paid for tampering with time.
And she gave her one and only life to save you.<NL>You cannot save your mother, boy...<NL>You have no mother to save.
Do you see now?<NL>You never had a chance.
There was never any hope.
No... It can't be true!<NL>It can't be true!
Nooo! Mom!

evk0340_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oliver!
Oh, why won't you wake up?
What happened to you back there?
How many days is it since poor Ollie-boy had his lights put out?
I-I don't know. I've lost count.
He opened the Soulsnare all full of hope, but instead of setting Alicia free, the pooer dab ended up being knocked out cold.
Come on, Ollie-boy!
Maybe it's ouer fault... Maybe we asked too much of you and youer magic powers.
Perhaps you're right.
Hold on! Where's Swaine got to now?
Him? Oh, he's lurking about outside, I reckon.<NL>As flipping usual...
Gah! He's never there when you need him!
Tell him to come back inside. Can't stay round by here forever, can we? We need to get Ollie-boy<NL>somewhere safe.
You're right...

evk0360_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Swaine!
Oh. Esther...<NL>It's you.
Why do you keep wandering off? You should be with us. With Oliver.
A fat lot of good that'll do! Having me around is going to help him snap him out of it, is it? Well? Is it?
That's not the point!
I know... Oliver saved us. His magic saved us.<NL>We owe it all to him...
Yes. We were brokenhearted, both of us, and...
And now look at us! We can't do a thing for him, can we?
Just when he needs us most, there's nothing we can do! Damn it!
Swaine... It's all right...
Oh, but there is something you can do...<page><NL>You can DIE!
Heh heh heh heh heh!
Th-That laugh...
But...<NL>But we beat you!
You think Vileheart can be defeated so easily?<NL>No. I am born of despair...
I am born of the darkness in man's heart...<NL>And there is plenty to go around!<NL>Heh heh heh heh heh!
Dammit! What do we do!?<NL>We don't have a hope in hell without Oliver!
What choice do we have!?<NL>We have to try!

evk0370_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tell me, Mom.
Everything I went through...
Was it all for nothing?
<KEEP>
Who's there?
Pea!
How did you get in here?
Easy-peasy!
I can go anywhere I like!
Gee...
I told you before!
I'm always here, Oliver!
Looking after you!
I...
I couldn't save my mom.
Everything I've been through...
...it was all for nothing.
No it wasn't!
Huh?
You gave something special to all those people.
Are you ready, Oliver?
Close your eyes!
No peeping!
Okay...
Hang on!
Stop working so bleeding hard, will you?<NL>You're making me look bad!
But I've never felt so full of beans!
To think, back then I could barely muster<NL>the energy to get out of bed!
Things really have changed around here, haven't they?
King Tom's got more enthusiasm than<NL>he knows what to do with these days!
You're not wrong! It's like a whole new place!<NL>And we owe it all to that young lad.
Those are the guards from Ding Dong Dell!
They were the very first people you ever helped!
One of them was brokenhearted.
I remember.
There's more! Listen!
Mmmyuh!? Hickory Dock's up to his old tricks?<NL>One shall soon knock some sense into the scoundrel!
Guess what, Miss Leila!<NL>My dad got up early to cook breakfast! And that's not all...
Do take some more, won't you?
There is enough in the palace larder for everyone!
We don't always require third helpings, you know!
Littlies! Who can tell their dear old mam what a fairy can't be doing without?
Yes! You, by there!
What's that?
Ho! Dead wrong, you are! It's laughter, en't it!
The reason us fairies are so cute<NL>is to give them humans a proper laugh!
Oliver's magic may still be somewhat unpolished...
He may still have some way to go to equal our prowess...
But I believe in him.
I believe in his gift...
Keep up, Genghis!
You gotta pick up the pace, boy!<NL>Hey! Don't tug the leash!
Listen, men!
From this day, we fly once more!<NL>And we do not fight for any kingdom.
We fight for all who stand against Shadar!
There is no cause for fear.<NL>Know that I will always stand beside you.
I will protect you from the wrath of Shadar.
So this piston goes here. And this one goes there...
Yah! I feel like my brain's gonna explode!
But I'm gonna crack this! You see if I don't!
The one who heals the brokenhearted...<NL>The savior of this world of sadness...
I'm talking about you, sweetie.
You were the one who was there for them all.<NL>It was you who healed their hearts.
I'm so proud of you, my Oliver.
Everyone was...
It was...
You see, Oliver?<NL>You gave something special to all those people.
It was me... It was me who...
Thank you... Thank you, Pea.
You're welcome!
I've got to go!
There are people who need me!
Yay!
Oliver...
That's your gift...
That's your power...
The power of your heart.

Is that really all you've got?
We can't do this...
Not on our own.
It's time to bring this charade to an end!
Yes!
Let's finish this!
はっ！？
Huh?
Oliver!
He he he he he!
Mornstar!
Grrraaaaaargh!
Ah!
Sorry! I got held up!
<KEEP>
I thought you'd never get here.
You will pay for this!

Esther! Swaine!
Let's pull together.
Let's show him the power of our hearts!
Mm.

evk0390_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oliver! Are you all right?
Me? I'm fine.
You're fine? Well, after a sleep like that, I suppose you should be!
You must have been worried.<NL>I'm sorry.
Never mind that! Tell us what happened to you!
I-I learned everything...
I learned the truth.

evk0400_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Blimey! Youer telling me the Great Sage Alicia was youer...
She was your mother?
That's right. The memories I saw... I think they were real. They were memories that only my mom and I shared...
But I made it back. Thanks to Pea.<NL>...Thanks to all of you.
What Pea told you was true. Everything you went through. It wasn't all for nothing.
Right! But I can't help wondering—who IS Pea?<NL>Where does she come from?
Hang on a flipping minute!<NL>Don't tell me Pea's Alicia and all!
No. She isn't. At least, I don't think she is.
Well, she's no normal little girl, that's for sure.<NL>That spell you just used came from her, right?
Right. And that's the spell that will help us finally<NL>beat Shadar.
At least, that's what I think. That's what I believe...
It's magic from the heart... Mornstar.
So this means we'll be visiting Shadar's castle after all, does it?
Yes. We have to finish this.
That's the spirit, mun! Let's get going, shall we!?<NL>Look out, Shadar, here we come!
It's time to go to <color:#1>Nevermore</color>...

evl0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Mwah hah hah hah!

evl0070_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Welcome to Nevermore.
Greetings, boy.
You have grown strong...
But are you strong enough to defeat me?
You bet I am!
Surely you are aware by now...
...that if you destroy me, you will be no more.
After all, you and I...
...are one and the same.
Huh!?
Wh-What did he say!?
(sighs)
The souls of those in this world are<NL>connected to those in yours, boy.
Live in this world, and<NL>you live in that world, too.
But should you die in this world,<NL>so, too, shall you perish in the other...
The two worlds are inextricably bound together.
<KEEP>
Just as we are...my soul mate.
Is he serious?
N-No...that can't be true!
But that is not all.
Because I have gained eternal life, you have been reborn many times over.
You should be grateful to me!
But I'm...
I see... It all becomes clear.<NL>You have no memory of any of this.
That wretched sage chose to<NL>raise you as a normal child.
Well, know this: it was I who gave you life.
The fathomless darkness within me<NL>required a suitable counterweight.
It was for this that you were created,<NL>O Pure-Hearted One.
Now, speak true...<NL>Do you still wish to destroy me?
(groan/sigh)
What are you going to do, Oliver?
Well, he can't fight him. That's for sure.
Maybe what Shadar says is true...but things just can't go on like this. I've got to put an end to it.
And I'm going to need your help.<NL>I want you right there beside me!
You what!?
But Oliver...!
You mean...
I will say it once again...
If you destroy me, it will be the end of you.
Do you truly mean to fight?
I don't care anymore!
In that case, let me welcome you...
...to my world!

evl0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I should have known!
We share a soul, after all.
But the darkness runs deeper than you know...
Much, much deeper...

Hah...
…！…あぁ…

evl0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So, you have repelled the soldier of my soul...
Impressive. But when despair consumes the heart, it gives birth to a power still more terrible...

I've still got a long way to go, you know.
I have to do my bit, protect my homeland...<NL>Defend the people of Bellicosia...
The order has been given!
We are to invade Rubicon, on the Halcyon border.
We march on the morrow!
The town harbors a sage who must be eliminated.<NL>Spare no one—women and children included.
An invasion?
Women and children...?
Why? Why must we go that far? This is wrong!
This is not why I studied magic!<NL>This is all wrong!

You must get away from here!
Gods, please let me save someone!
I'm scared...
Here! Take this!
It will protect you, I promise.<NL>Now, you must flee from here!
I-I'll try... Thank you...
Gaze upon the scene before you.
You know what it signifies, I trust?
But why...? Why do this?
My village... Everyone's homes... Why?
This is your punishment.
You made no attempt to engage the enemy,<NL>disobeying direct orders.
Worse, you let the sage's daughter escape.
I need hardly add that she would have proven a most useful pawn in this war.
The sage's...daughter?
You mean...? You mean that girl was...?
Oh, don't you worry—we'll get her soon.
Damn you!
What I did...
Was it wrong?
Was it my fault...?
Was it my fault they were killed?
Idiot! You couldn't even save one solitary life.
You know full well that girl is dead already.
What the hell is the point?
Why did I even try!?
There's no good in this world...
...only despair.
Embrace your despair.
For when despair devours the heart,<NL>it gives birth to the power of hatred.
It is despair that will overwhelm this world.
You are the Executor, charged with bringing<NL>destruction to this world.
I dub you...the Dark Djinn!

evl0180_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Wh...<NL>What was that...?
...Lucien.
He was so sad...
You saw it too, boy?
I should not be surprised.<NL>We are...connected, after all.
Shadar!
Let me tell you a tale...
Huh?
Once, there was a man who prayed.<NL>He prayed for an end to war...
And he prayed for power.<NL>The power to achieve his aim.
But his prayers went unanswered.
The man was driven to despair.<NL>His despair became the power he so craved...
...and the Dark Djinn was born.
So the man...before...it really was you?
It is a memory I cannot erase...
Shada— No! Lucien!
If that was what you really wanted...
...why would you try to destroy the world?
Because that is my role...my destiny...<NL>I am the Executor.
The Executor?<NL>What does that mean?
But that role is at an end.<NL>I must leave this place.
But you can't!<NL>What about...the real you?
You need not know my reasons...
Know only that I must leave.<NL>But you...
...you are destined to remain.
The link between our souls...<NL>It must be severed.
Huh?<NL>But we— I mean our hearts— You can't!
Be you, Oliver...
...and you alone.

evl0190_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oliver!
Can he really...?
Can he really be gone?
No... No, no, no, nooo!
...Huh?
Ollie-boy!
Youer all in one piece, mun!
I'm not dreaming this, am I?
But what about Shadar...?
He could still be here!
No, he's not.
Eh?
Shadar...
He's gone.
What? But...
He wanted to protect the world.
<KEEP>
He could have fooled me!
It's true. I saw into Shadar's heart. I saw it all.
Shadar... No.
I mean Lucien...
The truth is...

evl0200_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So this is how the tale of he who would destroy the world ends... It is a solitary fate...
But mine was ever so...<NL>I was always...alone...
You are not alone.
Alicia!
Your son is with me no longer...
Or have you come here to mock me?<NL>Hmhmhmhm...
No.<NL>I have come to speak to you.
Hm. What is there to speak of?<NL>You know nothing...
I know everything.
Hm?
I...flew...to the future. I saw a world shrinking in fear of you... The people...were still afraid. That had not changed.
...But one thing did surprise me.
It was a more peaceful age than the one from which I had come. There was no war...
That was what you wanted.
You wanted to protect our world.
Even after you became the Dark Djinn...
You... You presume!<NL>You do not know me!
Oh, but I do know you.
You...saved me.<NL>You saved my life.
...And you gave me this.
...No! It cannot be...<NL>You cannot be her...
Thanks to you, I saw many worlds...
And I lived many happy, carefree days.
And now, I have found you again.<NL>My savior.
But...that day... They caught you...<NL>I could not...
You wanted to put an end to war.
So you destroyed it all. Even your own country and its people. Because the war was their doing.
And in doing so, you freed me.
I... I wanted to...
I knew what you wanted. I knew what you had set out to achieve. That was why I tried to stop you.
I waited so long...
Yet in the end, it was not I who brought peace.<NL>It was the one who destroyed me...
But it was not I who was destined to defeat you...
...It was Oliver.
I cannot be forgiven for what I have done.
...I knew.<NL>I knew it was wrong.
But despair had consumed me...<NL>I could see no other way... And then...
...The White Witch.
You knew?
It is over now.
...It is.<NL>It is finally at an end.
Thank you.<NL>Thank you for guiding Oliver to his destiny.
How could I do otherwise?<NL>Our fates were...intertwined...
I must say good-bye to him, too.
Wait here for me...
...my savior.

The... The castle!
Esther?
Swaine?
Mr. Drippy?
Where are you?
Oliver.
Mom?
You've grown so much, Oliver.
Mom!
I know you'll be fine now.<NL>You don't need me to look after you anymore.
(sigh/gasp)
Oliver... You did so well, sweetie!
This is a pendant someone gave me a long time ago.
<KEEP>
I know!
I want you to have it.
Don't cry now, Oliver. It's going to be all right.
I'm so proud of you, my beautiful son.
Good-bye.
Thank you...
...Mom.
Oliver!
Oi! Ollie-boy!
What are you doing?
Had a nice nap?
You're all here!
Where else would we be!?
You just collapsed all of a sudden.
We were worried!
S-Sorry...
Get a load of that!
Huh?
It's so beautiful!<NL>It's like everything's awoken from a long sleep!
En't it?
So our tale's at an end.
Mom...
You gave me the greatest gift of all.
...My life.
Right, you lot. What's next?
Let's go see what's going on in the world!
Yeah, things should be back to normal now, eh?
Only one way to find out!

evl0220_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
And that was the story of the Dark Djinn.
In the beginning, Shadar wanted to protect the world.
And in the end, his dream came true.
It's over, Lucien.
That's right, isn't it, Mom?
Your Meowjesty!
The celebrations are about to commence!
Mmmyah... Yes!
But one cannot cut corners when it comes to grooming! Honestly!
It will only take one meowment!
But there's no time, Meowjesty!
A meowment, one said!
One simply must clean one's ears!
Neow where is it!?
Where did one's royal ear cleaner get to?
Ear cleaner!?
But Your Meowjesty!!!
King Hickory! Hurry up!
Calm down, you little pipsqueak!
I'm still black and blue after battling you-know-who.
Don't worry!<NL>King Tom's sure to call a ceasefire today.
Yaaaaaargh!
Come and get it, you mangy mice!
Ruuuuuun!
Doesn't that brat know I'm royalty!?
Hermana! Hermana! Look!
Look at the big house!
It's a castle, hermanito!
And look! What is that!?
Look how the water pours from it!
W-Wait for me!
Well, I've done MY preparations for the display!
Suppose you've been sat on your backside, Roman!
You've got some cheek!
Don't you worry, I've got everything under control.
But you've been sitting down all morning, and you reckon you've set up ALL your fireworks?
<KEEP>
That's right!<NL>Now, let's show this town what we've got, Catherine!
Time to start this party with a bang!
(Laughter)
Tidy! It's a proper party!<NL>Just like home!
This is what Shadar wanted, isn't it?<NL>To see the world at peace.
Well, so Oliver tells us...
I bet he's up there watching now!<NL>Him and youer mam...
Yeah!
I just know they are.
Now, I wonder if the Cowlipha and Marcassin<NL>have arrived yet?
Well, they're busy people.
There's still plenty of time...
Which means we've got time to enjoy ouerselves!<NL>Am I right, Ollie-boy!?

evm0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It's been a long time, Your Meowjesty!
Mmmyohh, hello! One hears congratulations are in order! You defeated you-know-wh— Myah, old habits! You defeated Shadar, did you not?
One always knew that you would, of course.<NL>One had absolute faith from the first.
Well, we couldn't have done it without you, Youer Meowjesty. We couldn't even have got near him without that Clarion.
Mmmyoh! One's little creation came in handy, did it?<NL>How very gratifying!
That's right! If the heads of the three kingdoms hadn't worked together, we would never have made it!
Mmm... Young Oliver, a hero... How time flies...<NL>You seemed like such an ordinary boy...
But you followed one's orders to the letter, and bravely set out to defeat the Dark Djinn...
Mmmyohhh, it seems like only yesterday...
Wh—!? That en't how it—! I mean... Do you think you might have...misremembered things a little,<NL>Youer Meowjesty?
Mmmyahaha! Why, of course not! But enough about oneself... Wanderer from another world, you and your companions have done well.
You have saved our world.<NL>What will you claim as your reward?
Good point! I'm sure we can think of something.<NL>Any ideas, Oliver?
I want... I want to go home...<NL>To Motorville...
Mmmmmmyuh!?<NL>Surely not?
...You've made up your mind, haven't you, Oliver?
I... I suppose it is your home, after all...
Well, yeah, but Alicia—<NL>I mean, youer mam...she en't...
It's okay.<NL>Maybe I couldn't save my mom...
...but meeting all of you, and coming to your world, and going on this adventure...
...it's made me stronger.
Heh. You can say that again!
Hee hee!
But...now I'm kinda...lost.
Traveling with all of you has been so much fun,<NL>and I've learned that there's nothing we can't do<NL>if we work together...
But...I started out on this journey because I thought I could save my mom...
...and now that's over.
Oliver...
So I have to go back to Motorville.<NL>It's where me and Mom lived together.
And Miss Leila's there, and Phil...<NL>And Myrtle, too.
Heh... Sorry, everybody...<NL>I should have spoken to you all about this.
It's all right, Oliver. It's your life.<NL>It's your decision.
He's right. You've really...<NL>You've really grown up, Oliver.
Of course he has!<NL>He's had expert guidance!
Ta very much! I must say, it's not been easy at times, but—
Stop it, both of you!<NL>What a pair of bigheads!
Heh...<NL>Hahaha!
So does this mean...all this...
The four of us...talking together...laughing together...<NL>It's all over?
No! You'll come back and see us, won't you, Oliver?
'Course he will! This is youer home from home now,<NL>en't it, Ollie-boy?
...Of course it is.<NL>Thanks, everybody!
Mmmyah-ha! One has just had a marvelous idea!<NL>Would you care to hear it?
Can't you see we're having a moment here, mun?<NL>...Fine. Go on, then—what is it?
We are having a grand celebration, are we not? Why don't we make young Oliver's departure part of the festivities?
Huh? I couldn't—
I think it's a wonderful idea!<NL>Please Oliver, say you'll do it!
Gee... I guess I, uh... Sure.<NL>Thank you, Your Meowjesty!
Purrfect! Then it is decided!<NL>You will have a hero's send-off!

evm0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So farewell...
Mmm...
んん！？
Yes.
Thanks for everything, Your Meowjesty.
So it's the end of ouer double act, is it?
You made one heck of a sidekick, Ollie-boy!
When you get home, you'll look out for Myrtle, won't you?
<KEEP>
Hey!
Come back and visit, you hear?
We'll go somewhere dangerous—for old time's sake!
You got it! Thank you, everybody.
Be good, Oliver!
But not too good!
ん？
See you next time ouer world's in a potch!
Take care! All of you!
Thank you!
Farewell, Oliver!
An end to pain...
Mmmyuh?
What's that?
Huh!?
What did you do, Ollie-boy?
Nothing, I promise!
Pitiful fools...
My gift of manna will cleanse your tainted souls.
This stuff...
What is it?
Huh?
うわ…、　うおぉ　(アドリブ)
うお！
Snow...? But it isn't cold...
Aaaaaargh! Ugh! Aaaaaah!
Aaaaaagh! My head... It's...
(gasps of horror)
ああっ
What is this?
What the heck!?
Mmmyah!
Mmm-mmmyah! Grrrowrrr...
Y-Your Meowjesty!
Oliver!
Marcassin!
You must come with me!
"Far, far away!"

evm0030_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...Oliver!<NL>.........Oliver!
Who's there...?
It's me! Pea!<NL>Oliver! It's falling!
The ash is falling again!<NL>I have to go back there!
Huh? Pea?<NL>What do you mean, "The ash is falling"?
...Wait! I get it!
You mean the manna, huh?
That stuff from before...<NL>Right, Pea?
Are you here now, in this world?<NL>Are you here in Ding Dong Dell?
Pea! Wait!<NL>Pea, wait for me!
Pea!
D-Don't scare me like that!<NL>Why are you shouting?
Wh-Where am I?
We're...flying...<NL>Wait, is this...?
It is, boy! You're back aboard the most formidable ship ever to sail the skies!
The Iron Wyvern!
Oliver!<NL>You're awake!
Prince Marcassin?<NL>What are you doing here?
It is quite a tale. Let me tell you all that has<NL>been happening...

evm0040_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
So it wasn't all a dream?
Sadly not. The manna...it changed them.<NL>It changed everything...
That's right, mun! And if it hadn't been for the Prince here, we'd have been changed into horrible beasties ouerselves! Proper close, it was!
What...?<NL>So everybody...<NL>Everybody in Ding Dong Dell is...
.........
By the time I arrived, it was already too late. Most of the people had already been transformed into those...things.
I was lucky even to be able to get you and your friends out of there...
Gee...
And it is not Ding Dong Dell alone. The three kingdoms have all been afflicted by the curse of the manna.
Ding Dong Dell, Al Mamoon...and Hamelin.<NL>All have been devastated.
That's awful!
Al Mamoon, too?<NL>Oh no...
How could this happen? After all we...and Mom...and Lucien...did to protect this world...
Who the flip is doing this, mun!?<NL>And why?
Well whoever it is, they're stupidly powerful.<NL>That ash wasn't the work of some two-bit villain...
"Ash"?<NL>Of course!
Pea!<NL>Pea knows something!
Pea?<NL>Have you seen her?
She was in my dream.<NL>She said...
She said, "The ash is falling again."
And you're sure she meant the manna?
What else could it be?<NL>And she said something else.
"I have to go back there."
What?<NL>Go back where?
I don't know.<NL>But that's what she told me.
Hmm... She visited you in your dreams.<NL>This is no coincidence...
Let's go see her! Wait here, Your Majesty! We'll go find Pea, and we'll ask her what she meant!
Will you, now...?
Then you must allow me to accompany you.
Huh?<NL>You want to come with us?
Don't you have subjects to be looking after, "Emperor"?
This is bigger than the Empire alone.
If there is even a small chance that it will help save our world, I must do everything I can.
You won't get any special treatment from us—you know that, don't you?
Of course.
...Fine.<NL>As Your Eminence wills it.
Let's show this manna-spewing maniac the power of the Great Sages!
Very well.<NL>Thank you...Brother.
All right! Let's go to Motorville and find Pea!
I leave affairs here in your capable hands, Captain Kublai.
There are many refugees aboard. I pray that you will use your stout heart to help them regain the courage to fight!
Aye, I will!<NL>Leave them to me, lad!
Huh? Why are these two being so chummy?
En't it, though? He pinched his map, didn't he?<NL>When did they kiss and make up?
Our world is in danger.<NL>We must put aside our petty squabbles.
And the theft of the map...<NL>It was for my own sake.
That it was! You needed something to snap you out of your wretchedness! You are an emperor, not a<NL>moonstruck goatherd!
Hm. I am...better now.
Heh. Finally learning to stick up for yourself, are you?
...I had a fine teacher.
Now, to Motorville! I entrust myself to<NL>your command, Oliver!

Manna...
The Forbidden Spell.
The death knell for this fallen world.
Indeed...
It rings out again, as once it did for Nazcaä.
<KEEP>
Each time this world ends, one cannot help but recall the name of that forsaken land.
The name I recall is "Shadar."
The one whom we termed "Executor."
Bringing an end to this world was his duty.
A task to which he was palpably unequal.<NL>And I will not even speak of his duplicity...
To think he shared a soul with the "savior"!<NL>And that he hid this fact from us!
It seems that mankind has disappointed<NL>Your Radiance yet again.
At the last...the Dark Djinn attempted to save this world...
To protect the very creatures<NL>that first plunged him into despair...
I will not be defied!
All who defy our will shall perish.
The mortal who shared a soul with Shadar<NL>still draws breath.
Should he too choose to defy our will...
...his reward shall be death, swift and certain.

evm0060_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Pea!<NL>You're here!
(sniff)<NL>(sob)
What's wrong, Pea?
Eh? She's there, is she?<NL>I still can't see her, mun!
Ask her about this ash stuff, will you?
Oli...ver...?<NL>Waaaah! (sob)
Pea?<NL>Did something happen?
Oliver! Oliverrr!<NL>It fell!
What fell, Pea?
(sob)<NL>It fell again...
The ash...it fell...and now everyone's hearts have gone all...bad... (sniff)
You mean over in the other world?
It was my fault...
Huh? No! Don't say that! It's not your fault, Pea!<NL>How could it be?
Waaaaaaaaahhh!!!<NL>It's all my faaaaaaaaault!!!
Listen to me, Pea! It's not your fault!<NL>We're going to fix this!
Pea! It was you who saved me, wasn't it?
I heard your voice...inside me...<NL>I've heard it so many times.<NL>It was you, wasn't it?
(sniff) Yes.<NL>I went to meet you.
Thank you, Pea. I knew it was you.
And that means there's no way it can be your fault.
...Oliver.
I have to go, Oliver.<NL>I have to go back there!
To the other world!
Huh? You want to go to the other world?
Okay, listen to me, Pea. It seems like there's some connection between you and the manna.
But you're a good girl, okay? You're a nice, kind person! This isn't your fault! I'll prove it to you, I promise!
So come with me!<NL>Come with us to the other world!
...Okay!<NL>I'll come with you!

evm0070_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
(gasp)
What's going on, mun?
No! I thought we would be safe here!
Oh no!
This place should be beyond the reach of the manna.
Can these poor people really be the ship's crew?
They've been turned into monsters!
え・・・！？
Hmph. Time for some target practice.
You can't!
We can't fight these people!
What? You'd rather let them tear us to pieces, would you?
<KEEP>
Hey!
Leave it to Pea!
Pea! Look out!
Please get better...
Sanckify!
Blimey! Did you see that?
She cured them...just like that!
Flipping Nora... A dwt of a thing like her letting rip with a blooming great spell like that? There's amazing!
So this is Oliver's imaginary friend, eh?<NL>Young what's-her-name... "Bean," was it?
You mean Pea?
That's me! I'm Pea!
But why is it that we can see her all of a sudden?
Ah, well, that's easy! Allow Prof Drippy to explain... We can see her cos she's in ouer world, en't it? And Ollie-boy could always see her cos she's from his world, obviously.
Ummm... Wait a minute...
Wouldn't that mean that...we should've been able to see her when we went to Motorville?
...Oh-oh-oh, I have to explain every little thing now, do I? I may be a fount of wisdom, but I've got my limits, right!
Quite. What we do know is that this girl destroyed the crystal. Clearly, she possesses the power to purify manna.
The spell she used... I have never seen its like.<NL>It was...miraculous.
Miraculous?<NL>No, it was Sanckify!
Sanck-i-fy!
Sanctify...?
So Pea could return those poor people in Ding Dong Dell to their old selves!
...Indeed she could. In this child, you have the solution to this...rather unfortunate problem you face.
Huh!?
It's you!
You were the one who sent us back to the past!
Yes. You may call me Gallus.
I am a member of the Council<NL>that determines the fate of this world...the Zodiarchs.
The Zodiarchs...?
The fate of the world...?
Oh yeah... And what would a busy fellow like you want<NL>with the likes of us?
I came to thank you.
Your power awoke the child.
The child?
Oh, you mean Pea?
I do. Through her, you now possess the power required to purify this world—Sanctify.
Sanctify!
You mean Pea's magic can save the whole world?
Indeed it can.
When you combine your power with hers...
...Doodle-Doo!
Ah, young Pea!
At long last, the one you have awaited has come.
Yep!
Now we're friends!
The time is close at hand.<NL>For both you, young Pea, and for you, Oliver.
I wish you well.
Bye-bye, Doodle-Doo!
Gallus...? The Zodiarchs...?<NL>I don't understand...
It seems some aspects of our world remain hidden<NL>even to us...
Never mind all that, did you hear what he said?
I sure did! Pea's magic can save the world!<NL>She can cure all the people who are sick!
But the three kingdoms are rife with horrors. We cannot send her into their midst. She is only a child.
I'm not a child!
Hang on a minute, Your Holiness, have you seen who you're traveling with? This lot aren't exactly grown-ups.
We can protect Pea. Please, Your Majesty, you have to trust us...and her.
She's one of us now.<NL>She's our friend!
Hee hee!<NL>Best friends!
You wish me to place my faith in her? As a friend and ally? ...It seems I have little choice.
Heh. All right, Little Miss Wizard, it looks like we're counting on you.
Pea! Let's save the world!<NL>Together!
Hooray!

evm0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It is even worse than I had imagined. The town has been completely overrun by these...things.
It's terrible...<NL>Who could do this to these poor people?
And there we were thinking the odd broken heart and a Nightmare or two were the end of the world...
But we have Pea on our side. We can bring them back!<NL>We can bring them all back!
Yes we can! With Sanckify!
Indeed. The spell destroyed the black crystal. And judging by what followed, it would seem that was the source of the manna.
Yeah, mun. I reckon there's probably another one round by here somewhere, en't it. Let's see what we can find, shall we?

evm0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup

I'm afraid you turned into a bit of a monster for a minute there. Okay, a complete monster...
Mmmyuh!?<NL>One remembers nothing...
It's okay now, Mr. Cat!
"Mr. Cat"!? Watch it you!<NL>This here's the king of a kingdom!
Such trivialities are of no concern to one at present, fairy. One is more worried about one's total loss of memory...
Don't worry! You're okay now, Your Meowjesty!<NL>Pea saved you—and all the townspeople, too!
Is that so? Then one must dust oneself off and put one's kingdom back in order.
Tidy! We'll leave things in youer capable, er...paws then, Youer Meowjesty. Ollie-boy—back to the Wyvern!

The manna was fed by the energy that flowed<NL>from the black crystals.
<KEEP>
They formed the cornerstones of the Forbidden Spell.
I am sure they did, but now they have been destroyed!
Surely a mere human could not have<NL>carried out such a deed?
Could he really be the one?
Your Radiance...
What do you intend to do about this?
Fear not.
The manna is but a foretaste<NL>of what is yet to come.
This trifling victory only delays the inevitable.
Indeed. The more mankind struggles, the more surely<NL>its fate is sealed.
Yes. They cling to a frail, fleeting hope,<NL>but it is soon to be torn from them.
To see mere mortals raise arms against Your Radiance...
An amusing spectacle!
We look forward to it.
Now, Gallus...
Are we to understand that you have<NL>had contact with the boy?
I have.
I wished to gauge his power.
Gauge his power?
...And you expect us to believe this?
Can it be!?
First Shadar...and now you!
You doubt the word of a fellow councillor?
Hah! What nonsense—!
Enough!
Y-Your Radiance—
Enough, I say!
Yes, Radiance.
May I, Your Radiance?

evm0120_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
That was amazing, Pea! So your magic really did have the power to purify the manna, huh?
Yes it did!<NL>We cleaned up the ash!
That's some proper potent magic you've got there, young 'un! You might even be better at this wizarding lark than Ollie-boy here!
Hee hee!<NL>Oliver's very good, too!
Here! A flower!<NL>It's to say thank you!
Huh?
I've never seen a flower like that before...<NL>Where did you get it, Pea?
It was where the crystal was!
The crystal? The black crystal that you destroyed?
What kind of flower thrives in a place full of monster-making ash?
Hee hee! It's my flower!<NL>You can have it!
Thank you very much, Pea!<NL>We'll take real good care of it!

Ummm...
You mean I'll be Queen Pea?
Yes. That is what is expected, Your Radiance.
Really?
I wonder if I'll be a good queen...
And so... The preparations for the succession are all in place.
All matters of state have been entrusted to<NL>the Council of Twelve.
That's right! You don't have to worry your pretty little head about a thing!
Look at her...<NL>Princess Pea hasn't the faintest idea what's going on!
She is no longer a mere princess!
Ah, you are quite right!<NL>Please accept my humblest apologies...

Queen Cassiopeia!
But Father called me Pea...
You're a big girl now. And after today's ceremony,<NL>you'll be known by your big grown-up name!
But, I...
Your subjects are all toasting your health,<NL>Queen Cassiopeia!

Youer flipping what!?
Pea, was that...?<NL>Was that really you?
Yes, silly!<NL>I'm Queen Pea!
You mean to tell us you're in charge of a whole<NL>country somewhere?
Then what are you doing here? You can't leave your kingdom in the lurch at a time like this!
Look who's talking!<NL>You left a whole empire in the lurch!
Ouch...
Ahem! Anyway! If what we saw just now is true...
...where exactly is this kingdom of youers, Pea?
Yes. We've flown all over the world on Tengri's back, but we've never come across anywhere like that.
You met her in your world, did you not, Oliver?<NL>Perhaps her kingdom is there.
I don't think so...<NL>Anyway, the flower...it's from this world.
That is true. Which would suggest that she is linked to our world somehow...
I'm bored!
Zip it, kiddo!<NL>The grown-ups are talking!
I told you, I'm not a chiiild!
Could have fooled me... Anyway, you said the flower was from where that black crystal was, en't it?
Yes!<NL>It was where the crystal was!
And there's other places where this manna's been falling, en't it? So...
...So there could be more crystals and more flowers in those other places!
And with those flowers may come more clues to Pea's true identity, and the location of her kingdom.
En't it, though? We'd better keep the flower we've got nice and safe, too. Could be important...
You're right! Pea, do you mind if we look after your flower for you?
You can keep it!
Um, as heartwarming as this is, aren't there still thousands of ash-monster people to save?
You're right!<NL>We have to go help them!

Y-Yes, Moojesty!<NL>Your wish will be fulfilled with all urgency...
We should get back to the Iron Wyvern, Oliver.

There's just one kingdom left to save now, en't it? I still can't get over Pea's magic, though. A proper little wizarding powerhouse, she is!
Hee hee! Proper!
Yes. Her magic can only be described as...miraculous.<NL>The spell...Sanctify...it is missing from the pages of the Wizard's Companion.
Oh! What about the flower? We thought if we found another one of those crystals, we might find another flower, didn't we?
Sorry to disappoint you, but I had a quick nose round while you lot were fighting away, and I couldn't find nothing, mun...
There was a flower!<NL>Look! It's here!
Eh!?<NL>Where the flip did you find that?
Do you think maybe only Pea can find them?
That would make sense. They seem to be linked to her past somehow. I wonder if this one will teach us a bit more about her...
I guess it might, huh.<NL>I'm kinda nervous about what we might find out...
Say, Pea, could you show us?
Of course I can!<NL>Here!

evm0170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Apus...
At least I have you to talk to.
What the Council are doing...
Can it be right?
Earlier on, I overheard the captain of the guards.
<KEEP>
He said the kingdom was in a parlous state.
He spoke of people too poor to buy bread,<NL>and of the starving dying in the streets.
Yet... The Council assure me all is well...
Just who is telling the truth?
Tell me, Apus.
This is most troubling. The Queen persists in her wish to involve herself in the affairs of state.
Should this continue, she may realize that it is we<NL>who now rule the kingdom, and alert the populace...
Surely it would do little harm to allow her<NL>to sit on the Council?
Provided that we keep the more...<NL>sensitive matters from Her Majesty's hearing.
Yes. And ensure that she is made publicly responsible for all of the Council's decisions.
Ha! A most splendid idea!
We shall keep our kingdom,<NL>while she takes all the blame!
(menacing, mocking laughter)
Father!
I know you will be proud of me!
Today the Council gave me their approval.
I am to be involved in the affairs of state.
Now I can work for the best interests<NL>of my subjects.
I have taken a long, hard look at myself.
And I have decided to put my subjects first, and do all I can to rid the world of war and famine.
Father...
I have learned of the existence of an ancient spell with the power to end all suffering...
I shall do you proud.
I vow that I will master that spell, and save my subjects and kingdom from despair.
Soon, Father...
Soon I shall bring the light of hope into the lives of<NL>my people...

evm0175_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Huh?<NL>Was that...Pea?
But she was all grown up, mun!
So...it wasn't her?
Come on, look at her! She's going to look exactly like the girl we just saw when she's that age!
...So you think we just saw a scene from Pea's future?
If that were the case, her kingdom would still<NL>exist somewhere...
Hmm... I wonder where it could be...
We thought we might finally learn the truth about Pea's identity, but it seems the mystery has only grown deeper...
Well, I know one thing—I'm not a fan of that Council of Twelve bunch. I'd trust them about as far as I could kick them. They're definitely plotting something.
Yes! Poor Pea!
Well, standing round gasbagging en't going to get us anywhere, is it? There's probably more flowers out there. Let's get on out and find them!
You're right. Pea, you'll tell us if you find another flower, won't you?
Yes!<NL>I'll find you another one!
Then we must head for the last of the three kingdoms.<NL>The battle is not won yet...

evm0180_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look! There it is!
Huh?
Aaah! Aaah!
So we're back here again...
Huh!?
Hm? Oh!
んっ！？
Stop youer whingeing, mun...
I mean it could be worse—
Knickers!!!
That tank...
That's the very latest weapon in Hamelin's arsenal!
I cannot say.
(gasp)
You're telling me machines are turning into monsters now?
<KEEP>
Oh!
Whoa!
It's just a machine! Let's show it what for!

evm0190_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Pea, it's time for your magic.
Right!
Sanckify!
Do you think that means everybody in Hamelin is<NL>cured now?
Yep. Which means it's time for the Prince to<NL>tend to his people.
Your Majesty!<NL>The city is in ruins!
Have we been invaded by wild beasts!?
I'd watch what you call them—they were you.
U-Us...?<NL>We were the beasts?
This is terrible!<NL>Your Majesty! Did we...attack you?
Calm yourselves. As you can see, I am unharmed.<NL>I am more concerned about the state of our great city...
But our chief concern should still be to discover the cause of all this. Until I have done so, I must leave Hamelin in your hands.
Captain Hogarth! Your orders are to begin reconstruction immediately!
Yes, Your Majesty! You go to war, do you not?<NL>You must take our latest technologies with you!
Your forethought is as welcome as ever, Captain.<NL>I leave the Empire in your capable hands.
Blimey. You actually sounded like an emperor for a moment there...
Yes! It was like I was seeing a completely different person!
I made a promise to my brother...
......Ahem.
In any case, Hogarth is a fine leader. He can be relied upon to rebuild Hamelin while I am gone.
There's trusting, you are! Righto, let's get back to the Iron Wyvern, shall we?

evm0200_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
We have saved the three kingdoms from the scourge of the manna.
As representative of the peoples of this world, I give you our heartfelt thanks.
You're welcome!<NL>But it was all thanks to Pea, really.
Yay!<NL>Thanks to Pea!
And yet...we are no closer to knowing who it was that sent the manna to assail us...
Your magic allowed us to avert a tragedy of<NL>unthinkable proportions, Pea. But we cannot<NL>allow this to happen again.
Too right, mun! We need to find whoever was behind all this, and give them a proper hiding!
But we have no idea who it could be...
Perhaps not...although something about Pea's story has been troubling me...
It has?
When we were in your world, she told you that the ash falling was her fault, did she not?
Well, sure, but— Hey! There's no way it was her!<NL>That's impossible!
Does it not also seem impossible that a tiny child should have the ability to reverse the effects of the manna?
And yet we have seen it with our own eyes. But that is not the only reason I think she may be able to tell us more.
I believe Pea may hold the key to unlocking this<NL>entire mystery.
Yes!<NL>Pea's got the key!
Oh, you found another flower, did you? Great, let's have another look at that pretty young queen!
Is this really the time for your stupid comments?<NL>We need to take this seriously!
Indeed. I fear this next vision may not be a pleasant one...
No matter. We must see the truth with our own eyes.<NL>Pea, would you be so kind?
Here!

evm0210_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
How...?
How could this happen?
<KEEP>
Every man, woman, and child in my kingdom!
Why did this happen?
Manna was meant to help them...
Not... Not...this.
Tell me why!
My name is Cassiopeia.
I am Queen of Nazcaä.
When I was a child, I was known as Pea.
I lived together with my father,<NL>and did not want for anything.
Then, when my beloved father passed away,<NL>I ascended the throne...
...little knowing what horrors awaited me.
Ignorant of the affairs of state, I allowed the Council of Twelve to control everything.
But the Council paid not the slightest heed<NL>to the well-being of my subjects.
I had always thought of Nazcaä as a peaceful realm.
But now, I saw that it was blighted by<NL>greed, and torn apart by conflict.
The scales had fallen from my eyes.
I felt the desperation of those ground down by poverty.
I felt the pain of those fighting for survival.
And I saw how I had lived a gilded life of luxury.<NL>A life they could never hope to enjoy.
I decided that I must change.
I would work for the good of others, and do all I could to eliminate conflict.
That is how I arrived at my decision.
That is what drew me to the spell that would save the world...
...Manna.
When I came to use that spell, not a doubt clouded my mind.
I was certain that the manna would<NL>purify the hearts of my people.
But then...
My dream of peace turned into a nightmare.
All those whom the manna touched became beasts, and turned upon each other.
For years, the nightmare went on.
The years stretched to decades...
...and still it continued.
Then, one day, I realized there was no one left.
The Council was gone...
The guards were gone...
My ladies-in-waiting, too...
They were all gone.
The manna I had unleashed had claimed the lives of every one of them.
I am completely and utterly alone.
But...death is a privilege I shall never know...
And who can say what this endless solitude may make of me?
That is why I have decided to fill these flowers<NL>with my memories.
If you have found this flower, I pray that you will find your way to me.
That is my only wish.
Until then, I shall be waiting...
Always waiting...
Alone in Nazcaä...

evm0220_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Crikey, there's tragic! The spell she used went and ruined her whole country!
The manna of which she spoke...
It's the same thing we've been dealing with here.
So the person behind all this is...Queen Cassiopeia?
She may not have intended any harm, but it seems a distinct possibility...
You're right. She said she would be waiting, didn't she?<NL>In a place called Nazcaä.
Smelly old Nazcaä!
Nazcaä, eh?<NL>Crikey, that's a blast from the past!
What? What is it?<NL>Do you know something about this place?
The fabled <color:#1>Kingdom of Nazcaä</color> was the seat of an advanced civilization that disappeared almost overnight...
...ten thousand years ago.
T-Ten thousand years!?
And Queen Cassiopeia has been waiting for all that time?
If we can find the site of the ancient kingdom, perhaps we can solve the mystery of the manna at last...
Yeah. And we can stop her from ever using it again.
Yes. We have to stop her!
All right! Let's go find the <color:#1>Kingdom of Nazcaä</color>!

evn0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Is this...an altar?
No, silly! They're my flowerpots!
...Flowerpots!?<NL>But they haven't got a single flower in them, mun!
Maybe...we need to put some in?
That's right!<NL>Flowers in the flowerpots!
Well, we could try plonking something in there, I s'pose. Can't hurt, can it?
Indeed. They must serve some purpose...

evn0030_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Whoa...!<NL>Wh-What's happening!?
Brace yourselves, everyone!
At last...we meet.
Cassiopeia...!
Wh-What's going on, Pea!?
All this time...
I have been waiting...
...here...in Nazcaä.
Nazcaä!?
I knew it! This island was the seat of the<NL>Nazcaän civilization!
What!? You knew all along!?
Not for certain...<NL>But you must have seen them too, my dear brother?
The ruins on this island... They are clearly the remnants of an incomparably ancient civilization...
You can do youer archeological lectures later, mun!<NL>What about that voice we just heard? If I'm not very much mistaken, that was—
Cassiopeia!
That's right, mun!<NL>The queen them flowers showed us, en't it!
My...flowers...
They guided you...
See! I flipping told you!
Shhh! She's trying to tell us something!
I have been...waiting...
And now...here...
...where...all began...
...time has come...
...my final act.

evn0040_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
My solitude stretched before me<NL>with no end in sight.
<KEEP>
All I had for company were my memories—<NL>the pieces of an ever more distant past.
I tried to hold on to the happy times,<NL>hoping to keep my loneliness at bay.
For how many years this continued, I cannot say.
And then, one day...
Can it be true?
Are you...me?
But why?
Just who do you think you are?
What... What do you want with me?
I see!
You came to accuse me.
To blame me for the loss of all those lives.
Well then...
I shall banish you from my sight!
(laughter)
That's right... Banish her!
Pour forth your manna and be done with them all!
Yes... That shall be my gift.
The gift of the White Witch!
We have awaited you, Your Radiance.
Councillors, my beautiful manna can end the world<NL>in an instant.
We need only choose when that instant shall be.
We may shape the fate of the world as we will,<NL>and start afresh whenever we please!
That is the power of manna!
Ha ha! Yes, Your Radiance!
I hereby call the Council to order...

evn0050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
What was that!?<NL>What'd we just see!?
The White Witch...<NL>Cassiopeia...!?
...Who'd have thought she'd turn out like that?<NL>So much for all those good intentions...
But how could—!? She was there! With Cassiopeia!<NL>Pea was there!
Cassiopeia is on her own...<NL>And she's very, very sad.
Please help her.<NL>Help Cassiopeia!
Silence!
Huh?
Look! Up there!
It's a castle...
A castle in the sky...
So, little girl...you are stirring up trouble once again.
<KEEP>
Cassiopeia!
Why do you strive to save this fallen world<NL>when my radiant manna would start it anew?
Manna...? You mean—?
Yes, it is I, the White Witch—arbiter of the fate of the world.
It is my decision and my right to bring this world to an end.
The judgment has been passed.
It shall not be overturned.
The White Witch...

evn0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I'd like to thank you all for agreeing to meet at<NL>such short notice...
Hmm... It is not often that one is summoned to a place like this. One presumes it is a matter of gravest import?
Indeed it is. We have identified the one responsible for the white ash that so nearly destroyed our kingdoms!
She is, in fact, the owner of the floating palace you see before you...
The White Witch!
She is the source of all this evil?
One sees... Noble friends...it would seem the time has come for our three kingdoms to fight as one!
Indeed! We would be grateful for any assistance<NL>you can provide.
The peoples of the world must unite.<NL>Our need has never been greater...
We are greatly moved by your call to arms...
Abull! Return to Al Mamoon at once, and instruct the viziers to prepare for war!
We shall need floaty things, swoopy things...<NL>and plenty of shooty things!
As you command, Your Moojesty.
Well, one cannot very well shirk one's responsibilities at a time like this! You shall have the finest soldiers Ding Dong Dell has to offer!
Excellent. The three kingdoms shall combine their strength, and strike as one!

evn0120_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Friends, the time has come!
Make ready to assault the lair of the White Witch!
<KEEP>
(roar of assent)
Oliver...
Don't worry, Pea...
It'll work—you'll see!
Now, men!
Prime the cannons! Fire at will!
Have some of that, Witch Face!
Keep it up, boys!
Anyone else think this is a bit too easy?
It is strange.
Why is no one fighting back?
I'm going!
Pea!
Wait! I'm coming, too!
And so am I!
But—! Doooh! Wait for me!
Hold on!
Don't leave the hero behind!
Is everybody ready?
You're planning to fly through that hail of<NL>cannon fire, are you?
Would you rather stay here?
No, of course not!
Wait!
Do you have room for another?
Because I mean to see this to the very end!
Prince Marcassin...?
...O-Okay! Hop on board!
Splendid!
We're ready, Tengri!
(dragon screams)
Whooooooa!

evn0130_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...Huh!?
All that firepower, and not a scratch on it!
Just as I thought. It's invulnerable.
No matter.
The primary purpose of that attack was to<NL>unite our forces behind a common cause.
<KEEP>
Oh...? Really?
Yes, I thought that might be the case!
You big liar!<NL>You were scared out of your wits!
Scared? Me!?
You're clearly hysterical!
You guys!
She's waiting for us...
The White Witch...
Cassiopeia...

evn0140_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Everything all right, Pea-bach?
It's that man again!
Doodle-Doo!
Pea...
The Queen...<NL>She cannot yet be saved...
A barrier surrounds her heart—one formed in the depths of her isolation. Until that barrier is broken...
I can do it!<NL>I can break it!
So...you mean to try again, little one?<NL>I fear you will not stand much chance alone.
I'm not alone!
I'm with Oliver!<NL>And Oliver's friends!
Huh!? P-Pea...
Ha ha ha ha!
And you are sure about this, Pea? You would stake all upon this boy? ...Hm! Then first, he must prove to me he is ready to bear such a burden.
Please, Oliver!<NL>You have to fight Doodle-Doo now!
You need that wand, but he'll only give it to you if you beat him!
B-But, Pea...I...
...Okay! If he wants us to beat him, then I guess that's what we'll do!
Come, Oliver the Savior!
<KEEP>
Let me put your powers to the test!

evn0150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...Excellent.
It would appear that my ghost is no match for you.
Uh... Your ghost...?
Doodle-Doo's not alive anymore!
Doodle-Doo is a wand!
A wand? You mean...that wand?
Indeed.
I am a soul. The soul that resides within the wand known as Astra.
A soul inside a wand?<NL>I suppose this wand is something like Mornstar, then?
That is correct. Astra is Mornstar's twin.
I gave you Mornstar that you might find your way to me. The child...likewise.
What do you mean, "likewise"?
The Queen banished Pea to your world, Oliver. I had her meet you there, to show you the "Gateway" to ours.
She gave you a wand made from a branch of the Nazcaän Sky Tree, thus granting you its considerable power...
A wand made from the Sky Tree...?<NL>You mean—? That stick I found!?
Yes! Hee hee!<NL>Doodle-Doo gave it to me!
Pea led you to this world. And she has continued to lead you, all the way here...
But why are you doing this? Do you not serve the White Witch? Are you not a member of her council?
Ha! I work for no one. This mask—this "Gallus"—is a necessary pretense, nothing more.
It enabled me to get close to her. To watch over her...
To protect my daughter...
Your daughter?<NL>You mean...the White Witch is...!?
Blimey!<NL>You're Cassiopeia's father!?
After my passing, Cassiopeia...lost her way. She called down the manna with the best of intentions...
And despair was her reward. It was only then that she became the "White Witch" as you know her now...
Now my beloved daughter cannot see for the darkness that engulfs her... She is lost and alone in a world of her own making...
Her own...world?
It pains me that it should have come to this. I had hoped I might make her see the error of her ways... But it proved too great a task for a mere spirit...
It is up to you now.<NL>You must save my Cassiopeia!
Use this wand to crush the evil that has enveloped her heart. Displace her mask—reveal the innocent princess whose face it hides!
Doodle-Doo!
So he did all this for his daughter...?
Doodle-Doo asked you to help him, Oliver...
Yes. And that's exactly what we're going to do.<NL>We've got Astra now. Nothing can stop us!
We have to save the White Wi—
...No! We have to save Cassiopeia!

evn0160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Jeepers!
You are late, Oliver.
So you're—
Behold, the overseers of the world's fate...
...The Zodiarchs.
So you shared a soul with the Dark Djinn.
<KEEP>
Know then that this world made him what he was.
His despair was born of its rank imperfection.
I gave him the chance to bring this world to an end.
He failed. But I shall not.
And yet you would have us believe that this is<NL>a world worth saving?
I should very much like to hear you argue that case...
Come...tell us what the world is worth.
Come, boy.
Let us hear what you have to say.
(mocking laughter)
(gasp)
Oliver!
It's okay, Pea...
It's all going to be okay.
This world is full of people doing their best to live their lives. It's their world, and I won't let you destroy it!
Those are bold words for a brat like you to utter...
Pah! This is the child the prophecies speak of?
That Gallus would betray us for one so foolish!
Is he trying to claim that mankind
is of the slightest value?
He really thinks his witless objections
can sway the Council?
He won't let us destroy it?
Don't make me laugh!
Defending mankind is a fool's errand.
Defeating Gallus has given him delusions of grandeur!
He thinks juggling pieces of heart makes<NL>him an expert on the human condition?
Why does he say nothing of human weakness?
How dare he even dream of opposing us?
Pathetic! Must we listen to this?
We are the Council!<NL>Our decisions determine the fate of the world!
You're wrong.
You're alone, Cassiopeia...
You always have been!
Huh?
They're gone...
Are you all right?
Huh? What just happened?
It was something Gallus said.
He said she was locked inside her own world.
You mean to say that entire council was<NL>a figment of her imagination?
...Her magic was so strong, it turned her thoughts into reality.
Wait! Hold on a second!
Then what made the White Witch disappear?
Was she an illusion, too?
No! The White Witch is real...
...and she's in there.

evn0170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
How dare you!?
This is Her Radiance's inner sanctum!
Did you not hear me? Be gone from here!
Apus. That is enough.
<KEEP>
As you have no doubt deduced, Apus was but another phantom created by my memory.
Yes...
Another illusion.
How long has it been, Pea?
How long since...?
(gasp/sigh)
Cassiopeia!
Why...?
Why do you have to destroy the world?
Because it is imperfect.
Imperfect like the human heart.
Long ago, my own was consumed by the blackest despair.
But then I discovered something,<NL>on the furthest shores of solitude...
I found true strength.
Strength enough to remake the world!
But you didn't have to flipping go and use it, did you?
He's right!
You're not the only person in the world!
The world might not be exactly how you want it, but that's no reason to just get rid of everyone!
You can't do that! It's wrong!
It's wrong! It's wrong!
SILENCE!
Aaaaaargh!
The world is mine to remake as I see fit!
And none shall defy my will!
Weak-hearted humans!<NL>I condemn you to suffer...
...forever.

evn0180_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Just as the prophecy foretold...
Very well!
Huh?
Where's this, then?
Oliver!
Look!
Oh, no...<NL>I've got a bad feeling about this...
<KEEP>
She's...changing...
(gasp)
Cassiopeia! You can't destroy the world!<NL>I won't let you!

evn0190_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
No... Why...?
This world is imperfect...
It must be destroyed so that a new one may begin...
No! You can't just tear it up and start over!
It may not be perfect, but nothing is.
So you make the best of what you've got!
When things go wrong, you have to try and make them right. And you have to keep on trying, no matter how hard it gets.
<KEEP>
That's what life is all about.
...Life?
(violent sobbing)
Even when you're all alone, you can't give up.
Sooner or later, someone's sure to come along.
I met Pea, didn't I? And she...
Well, she's a part of you.
Mm-hm! And I met Oliver!
Oliver, you're my friend!
Aww, Pea...
Life's never perfect... It's always changing.
Meetings... Farewells...
Happy times... Sad times...<NL>You take things as they come, and you keep on going.
That's just how it is.
You're so kind, Oliver.
But Oliver...
Don't be angry with Cassiopeia.
She was so sad. She didn't know what to do.
That's why I was born!
But now you've made her better, and that means I don't have to look after her anymore.
Huh?
Oliver...I have to go now.
Bye-bye.
Oh!
Thank you for everything, Oliver!
This must be...
The real Cassiopeia.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I am Queen Cassiopeia...as I was long ago.
I will be forever in your debt.
You have restored me to my true self.
I heard your words.
And now, I can begin to live again!
Thank you, Oliver.

What's going on?
We are the Zodiarchs, the Council that decides<NL>the fate of the world!

But didn't you just imagine them?
No... This... This has nothing to do with me!
Can they...?
Can they have become real?
That is correct!
We have slipped the reins of your magic!
The ruddy cheek!
Get back in her head, you rotters!
Is this...a declaration of independence?
This is all my fault.
Run from here!
No way! We're staying right here!<NL>You don't have to do this alone!
We can defeat the Zodiarchs together!
Yes!
Too right we can!
Come on!
Very well.

But take things one step at a time.
I will.
And my first step
shall be flowers!
Flowers?
Yes! I shall fill this palace to the
topmost tower with their beauty!
I want to see
smiling faces.
I want to make
everyone happy,
just as they once were.
I want to bring out the best in this world!
You can do it,
Your Majesty.
I just know you can.
And when I do,
I want you to be here.
I want you to see the world you saved!

evn0230_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
My, you ARE an early bird!
<KEEP>
Morning, Miss Leila!
It's such a help having you around, dear.
I love my job!
So you take this piston...
And you connect it here...
All right!
I'm gonna crack it this time!
You see if I don't!
(breathes out as he lands)
Mom, I'm going to get on with my life...
And I know you'll always be watching over me...

evw0010_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Looks like we'll be your first opponents.<NL>Don't underestimate us just because we're small!

evw0020_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You didn't have to take it so seriously...<NL>We're only little, you know!
Next you shall do battle against us!
We are the babana merchants of Al Mamoon! We fight so that the world may know the delight of all things babana!

evw0030_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ha! That's what you get for holding back!<NL>Told you we could take it!

evw0040_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
A wonderful performance! ...Would you perhaps be<NL>interested in doing some promotional work for my<NL>babana stall?
Ah, it would seem we are to be your next opponents. Needless to say, the prize money on offer is of little consequence to us...
But we shall nevertheless accept it should we win. We did not amass our fortune by looking gift horses in the mouth, after all! Ahem.

evw0050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It would appear that your defeat has left you rather downhearted... At times like these, a nice ripe babana is what you need!

evw0060_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Impressive... How about you come and work for me as my bodyguards? I'll double—no, triple your current salary!

evw0070_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
What!? I knew the prize money wouldn't be much, but this is pathetic! An utter waste of time...

evw0080_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Allow us to show you what grimalkin are capable of! Purrepare yourselves!

evw0090_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oh my! You're purretty good at this!
It seems we are your next opponents.
I imagine the sight of our outfits makes you want to go to the beach, yes? Well, defeat us and we shall think about taking you! Hee hee!

evw0100_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oh. I thought you'd purrform a bit better than that,<NL>I must say!

evw0110_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I suppose you want us to take you to the beach now, no? Well...perhaps when you are a little older!
Long time no see, Oliver! You're up against me next!
Have you met my new friend? I found him while I was playing by the seaside. Watch out—he's really strong!

evw0120_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oh dear... You were too busy thinking about the beach,<NL>I think!

evw0130_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Cor, handling familiars is harder than I thought...<NL>You make it look so easy, Oliver!

evw0140_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Wow! I beat you, Oliver! Looks like I'm getting pretty good at handling familiars, eh?

evw0150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Here...no forest. Forest...where?<NL>Want to...go back.

evw0160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Now...I go back?<NL>Go back...to forest?
We're up next, are we? Tidy!
We're the Three Twins—but we en't feeling ouerselves today. Broken-arted, we are, the lot of us... Hmph.<NL>You don't seem very surprised.

evw0170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Forest is...where?

evw0180_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Flipping heck, mun. First Smiley 'n' Surly steal ouer thunder on stage, and now you give us a thrashing!<NL>Mam'll never let us hear the end of this...
It is I, ze one and only Automateur!<NL>And you are to be my next adversaire, n'est-ce pas?
Observe beside me ze greatest création robotique ze world has ever seen! Ze force, ze grâce... Do you really sink you will triomphe over 'im?

evw0190_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I may be broken-arted, but I know something that folks'll laugh at—you lot, en't it! Better get back to Teeheeti and tell everyone the joke!

evw0200_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Non...mon ami robotique!<NL>I was so certain...so certain 'e was invincible!

evw0210_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Magnifique! Victoire was certain from ze very beginning—just as I sought! Oui, mes créations robotiques are véritable works d'art!

evw0220_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Phew, it is being very hot here, yes?<NL>We are winning so we can be going home quickly!

evw0230_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You are doing the really great fight.<NL>Oh...but I am being even more hot than before!
It is us now, no?
You look at our stylish hats, I think?<NL>Ha! What counts is underneath them, chico!

evw0240_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Wow! We are having won!<NL>This is being really great, yes!?

evw0250_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You win the battle... But we win the war!<NL>The only war that matters...<NL>Si, chico—the style war!
Oi! What's all this about, then?
Why are we being made to fight in this silly Solosseum thing? We're just simple firework makers!

evw0260_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Bad luck, chico. Maybe you try wearing a hat next time?<NL>It won't help you win, but at least you lose in style, eh?

evw0270_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
That's what happens when you force firework makers onto the battlefield!

evw0280_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
We may have won, but I've still got a bleedin' mountain of fireworks to make! It's high time I got back to work!

evw0290_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
We are the Three Little Pigs! And before you ask, no, we're not THE three little pigs. They were real pigs.<NL>We merely wear pig-themed armor. Every day.

evw0300_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ho ho! There's nothing like a mask for hiding one's blushes after a shameful defeat!
We shall be your next opponents!
Ah, I see you admiring our wings. We made them ourselves, as it happens. They're our tribute to Xanadu, and the dream of flight! Nice, aren't they?

evw0310_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
What's the matter? Did our masks distract you or<NL>something? Well, now you know why we never<NL>take them off!

evw0320_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hmm...it seems we're not quite ready to soar just yet...
Where are we...?
We are soldiers of Bellicosia, boy. Do you...mean to challenge us? Well, if it's a fight you want, a fight you shall have. I warn you, though—we will show no mercy!

evw0330_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It would appear that we've something of a talent for battle. Perhaps we should make some armor to go with these wings!

evw0340_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hmm... Such formidable fighting...<NL>What could this place be...?
You have done well to come this far.
Hm hm... You seem surprised to see me. It was Solomon who asked me to be your next opponent.
It was also Solomon who provided me with these creatures... With their aid, I will see if you have what it takes to become a sage!

evw0350_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
How could a mere child expect to defeat proud soldiers of Bellicosia? Speaking of which...where are we, exactly?<NL>We must needs return to our posts.

evw0360_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
It gladdens me to see how powerful you have become!<NL>As predicted, the difficulties you have overcome have<NL>only served to make you stronger!

evw0370_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hmm. Perhaps you are not yet ready for the challenges that lie ahead...

evw0380_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Muahahaha! We shall be your first S Rank-k-k-k<NL>opponents! Do be gentle with us, won't you?<NL>No need to fight as if your death depended on it!

evw0390_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I thought I told you to be gentle with us!? If you're half as good at gambling as you are at fighting, I would ask that you stay away from my c-c-casino!
What d'you mean we'll have to split up the act if we lose!? Want to replace me with someone proper hard, is it? Smiley 'n' Burly, eh!?
Well it en't going to happen, mun! We're winning this flipping fight whether you like it or not. Sorry, Drippy-boy—but this is business!

evw0400_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You must be feeling a little low after your defeat... If you need something to tak-k-k-ke your mind off it all, why not pay a visit to our c-c-casino? We adore losers!

evw0410_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Well that was a flipping disaster! Maybe I'll team up with Burly, myself. "Surly 'n' Burly" has got a nice ring to it... Nah, scrap that—he's thicker than you!
My turn!
Hello there, Ollie! I heard about the competition, and thought I'd give it a go. This should be fun!
Now you'll get to see for yourself what the Sage of Ages is really capable of!

evw0420_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Looks like youer timing was a bit off there, Drippy-boy. Hold on! Youer not...broken-arted, are you!?

evw0430_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
The Sage of Ages, defeated in battle!?<NL>...When did you get so tough, Ollie?
I'd say you're pretty close to becoming a sage yourself. Keep up the good work!
Doing well, aren't you?
Ha ha ha! Don't look so surprised! You must have known I'd be the ultimate challenge of the Solosseum! Then again, you are a bit slow...
To be honest, I didn't think you'd make it this far...<NL>You've obviously toughened up since I last saw you.<NL>What can I say? I'm an amazing teacher.
Still, I doubt you're going to cause me too many problems. In fact, I predict another easy victory for the Supreme Sage! Boooring!

evw0440_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ha ha! You'll have to do better than that if you want to defeat the Sage of Ages, Ollie!

evw0450_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ha! Not bad! Maybe you aren't as rubbish as I thought!
I wasn't trying very hard, of course, but you still did all right. You may even have what it takes to be a sage. Not a supreme one though, obviously...
I suppose you probably deserve a reward...<NL>Go on then, but only because I'm so nice.

evw0460_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ha! You lose! Just as I predicted. You've got a long way to go if you want to be a sage—and even longer if you want to beat me!

evy0008_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Savor the flavor of the legendary tikka mahala!
<KEEP>
Wow! This smells great!
It really does! Wow!
Sorry, mun, I just can't hold back!<NL>I'm going in!
Yeah! Me, too!
Here goes!
Crikey!
This spicy beef and veg is a marriage made in curry heaven!
The Raj Mahal is a spicy oasis in a desert of disappointment!
I never had it before, but this is the best curry I ever ate!
Ahh, you are surprised and elated, I see!
The Sheikh's special spices never fail!
The delicate harmony of spice and tender beef intertwining with the subtle aromas of...
Om nom nom...
But they are not listening to a word I say!
Ah well...
Eat friends, and be merry!
Raj's curry pot never runs dry!
Yippee!

evy0105_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Hey! Ollie!
Over here!
Huh?

evy0110_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Good thing you found me. Guess what?<NL>She's finally ready!
You mean...?
What else would it be, dumb-dumb?
Jeepers! Can he really mean...?
Sorry I kept you waiting, Ollie!
Phil! Y-You mean... You built this?
Sure I did! Listen to that engine purr!<NL>C'mon, Ollie! You're in the driving seat!
I-I'm in the driving seat?
Whoa! Whoooa!
Whoooooooooa!

evz0100_text_en.cfg.bin.kup

evz0150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Look, Ollie-boy! The big lump's only gone and knackered himself! Now's your chance to give him a proper walloping!

evz0200_text_en.cfg.bin.kup

evz0300_text_en.cfg.bin.kup

evz0350_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
...Oooh! I know!<NL>Hold on a sec, Ollie-boy!
Take this, you big bully!
Tidy! Now's youer chance, mun!

evz0352_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I've got a bad feeling about this, Ollie-boy! He looks like he's about to go flipping ballistic!
Put youer guard up, mun! Quick!

evz0400_text_en.cfg.bin.kup

evz0500_text_en.cfg.bin.kup

evz0750_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oi, Ollie-boy! This beastie by here's got a big old shield protecting his back, en't it? Better give him a whacking from the front, I reckon!

evz0950_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
You know that monsters who live in cold places don't like fire, don't you, Ollie-boy? Well, this big pooch is no different! Go on, mun, give him a roasting!

evz1050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
What the flipping heck...!? There's loads of little things coming out of it, mun!
Mind you, it looks proper knackered after popping that lot out. Now's youer chance to give it a smack or two, Ollie-boy!

evz1150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ych-a-fi... I flipping hate snakes, I do... Make sure that slimy so-and-so doesn't come anywhere near me, Ollie-boy! I'll faint!
Me and my phobias... Weigh me down, they do... Oooh! There's an idea! Pop something heavy on top of that thing and it'll soon stop slithering! Use magic if you have to!

evz1350_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Take it from me, mun—you'll never put a dent in that mechanical monstrosity unless you use magic or one of youer familiars' tricks!
A spot of storm magic should do nicely. These mechanical types en't exactly fond of lightning, see!

evz1450_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Crikey! I've never seen a dragon this big before, mun!<NL>The flipping thing looks proper vicious!
Ouer only hope is poison, Ollie-boy. Dragons hate the stuff, see. Wait till its guard is down, then have Swaine shoot the blighter full of the rotten muck, en't it!?

evz1550_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Here's a handy hint for you, Ollie-boy: evil types that use a lot of darkness attacks are weak against light attacks...
So it's just as well the Emperor gave you that spell, en't it!? You know the one I'm on about, don't you? The lighty one, yeah.

evz1650_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
That Viledriver attack is a right pain in the proverbial... Make sure you protect youerself from it, Ollie-boy. Defense is the best form of attack, en't it!?

evz1655_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Crikey! Old Vileheart's gone all red in the face... Hit him with the spell to end them all, Ollie-boy! Attack is the best form of defense, as I always say!

evz1850_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Come on, mun, get a grip!
You need to watch out for that Tailspin attack, Ollie-boy! It'll get youer familiars all flustered, see.
Mind you, that thumbelemur of youers en't the sort to get <color:#1>confused</color>. I reckon this might be his time to shine!
Press [btn_l1] to switch familiars!

evz1851_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Come on, mun, pull youerself together!
You need to watch out for that Tailspin attack, Ollie-boy! It'll get youer familiars all flustered, see.
Mind you, that thumbelemur of youers en't the sort to get <color:#1>confused</color>. I reckon this might be his time to shine!
Press [btn_l1] to switch familiars!

evz1852_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ha ha! The furry fool's only gone and tripped himself up! Now's youer chance to give him a good hiding, Ollie-boy!

evz1950_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Even big beasties like this have weak spots, Ollie-boy! Try and get round the back of it and attack its tail!

evz2000_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oi, Ollie-boy—is it just me, or does he do different attacks when his aura changes color? I reckon he does, you know!
Knowing what type's coming might help you choose a familiar with the right affinity for each color, en't it?

evz2050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Flipping heck, is he really going to try and poke you with that parasol!? Now's youer chance to give him what for, Ollie-boy!

evz2150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
That dirty cheat keeps pinching youer HP, Ollie-boy! Make sure you whack him sharpish if he looks like trying it again. It's the only way you'll stop him!

evz3050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Crikey, some of this dark magic is helluva powerful!<NL>Still, the light spells you've got en't too shabby either.<NL>Give that rotter a taste of Mornstar, mun!

evz3060_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oh knickers... Knickers, knickers, knickers! I've got a feeling something terrible's about to happen, Ollie-boy. You'd better keep youer guard up!

evz4050_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oof! That big swing of his is a flipping killer! You got to try and get youer attack in first so he can't let rip with it, en't it!

evz4100_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oh, knickers! He's standing up! You know what that means, Ollie-boy! Make sure you hit him hard before he brings them claws to bear, and knock him out of his stride!

evz4200_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Crikey, it looks like she's getting ready for a bodyslam! Watch youerself, Ollie-boy! She's a heavy weapon and no mistake!
Hang on... Maybe if we made her even heavier, she wouldn't be able to get off the ground! Go on, mun! Try using a spell to weigh her down!

evz4300_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
This thing might be different from that tank we fought before, but it's got the same weaknesses as any other machine! Give it a taste of storm magic!

evz5100_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Flip, mun! Have you seen them orb thingies in the middle of his chest? Look proper dangerous, they do! But vulnerable, too... Go on, give 'em a whack!

evz5150_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Flipping heck... I can feel the White Witch's power from over by here, mun... Make sure you dodge her spells, Ollie-boy. Or block them... Or something!

evz5160_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Oh knickers... There's something bad on the way, Ollie-boy! Whatever you do, make sure you stop it!

evz5170_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Is everyone all right?
I'm sorry, I must not allow them the time to use such attacks!
Help her out, Ollie-boy! You've got to hit them before they can hit you, en't it?

Use [stk_l] to <color:#1>walk</color> over to where Philip is standing.
<REACTION>Approach Philip and [ico_tlk] will appear. Press [btn_ok] to speak to him.
Here in my world, you can use [stk_r] to change youer <color:#1>viewpoint</color>!
If youer having any trouble with the controls, go to <color:#1>Settings</color> in youer Main Menu and have a fiddle with them.
The <color:#1>mini map</color> will be displayed at the top right of the screen as you travel around.
This map lets you see your immediate surroundings.
Press [btn_r1] to switch to the <color:#1>local map</color>, showing an overview of the whole town.
[ico_nxt] lets you see where you need to go next. Your first port of call is Oliver's house.
Open the <color:#1>Main Menu</color> and press [btn_sta] to <color:#1>save</color> your game.
Once you have saved your game, you can select <color:#1>Continue</color> from the title screen to restart from the point where you left off.
Allow me to explain a little more: touch a <color:#1>waystone</color>, and youer <color:#1>health and magic power will be fully restored</color>!<NL>Not bad, eh?
And that's not all, mun! These little beauties'll also let you <color:#1>save</color> youer progress. A traveler's best friend, they are!
Ouer world is absolutely riddled with <color:#1>monsters</color>!
If one of 'em spots you, you'll see a big [ico_hit] pop up over its head, and it'll charge. When it gets within touching distance, you'll have a fight on youer hands!
If you run out of HP in the middle of a battle, you'll be out for the count—so be careful, en't it!
Oh, and here's a tidy little technique for you! If you sneak up behind monsters without them noticing, you can get the first hit in, giving you the upper hand!
The only thing is, it works the other way round, too. If a monster sneaks up on you, they'll be able to get the first hit in, the rotters!
Allow me to tell you a little more about that <color:#1>Locket</color> of yours.
You will see that it has a habit of <color:#1>glowing brightly</color> from time to time.
This is how it reacts in the presence of those who possess one of the heart's virtues in abundance.
Now, listen here.<NL>You see how far away I am from that chest?
Pretty far, right? And you wouldn't think I'd have a hope of reaching it, would you? Well, that's where my <color:#1>pickpocket's pistol</color> comes in!
I just use [stk_r] to lock on to the target, and then press [btn_ok] to fire. Simple, eh?
Of course, the nice thing about treasure chests is that they never run away. They're what's known in the trade as easy marks!
Right then! Here goes nothing...
Press [btn_tri] to open the <color:#1>Main Menu</color>.
You will then be presented with a range of options.
Use [key_all] to select an option, and press [btn_ok]. Having chosen an option, you can return to the Main Menu by pressing [btn_can]. Press it again to return to the game.
Additional menu options will become available as you progress through the game.
Look up at the top left of the <color:#1>Main Menu</color> and you'll see youer <color:#1>Bottomless Bag</color>.
In there, you'll find all youer items nicely sorted into different categories. There's handy!
Use [btn_l1] and [btn_r1] to shift between the categories. 'Course, there en't much to see at the moment, but when you've got loads of stuff, you'll be glad of a bit of order, en't it.
Anyway, next time you pocket a tidy item, be sure and have a closer look at it in youer Bottomless Bag!
If you look in the <color:#1>Main Menu</color>, you'll see <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color>.
That's where you'll find all sorts of details about you and youer familiar's abilities.
It looks a bit complicated—and there are a fair few options kicking about in there, to be fair—but you'll soon get the hang of it, mun!
If you want to see what tricks youer familiars have up their sleeves, choose <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color> from the Main Menu.
Tricks are a bit different from magic. Each individual trick fills a single command slot, you see.
Press [btn_tri] when youer in the Friends &amp; Familiars bit, and you can <color:#1>change the command slots used for tricks</color>.
Which reminds me—a familiar can only remember a maximum of <color:#1>eight tricks</color> at any given time.
Meaning if you want them to learn a new one, you'll have to make them forget one of their old ones. Bit of a pain, like, but at least you can teach an old familiar new tricks!
Of course! All you need to do is <color:#1>switch your familiars around</color>!
Just select <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color> from the Main Menu.
Trust me, it's really easy. Select a familiar, press [btn_squ], and then choose where you want it to go.
To ensure your familiars don't get cawt short, you can give them a boost by <color:#1>equipping</color> them with certain items!
I don't want to crow, but you'll find plenty of items your familiars can equip among my wares.
There are three types: <color:#1>weapons, armor, and accessories</color>.
Just remember that the items a familiar can equip vary acawding to its genus.
It's not complicated, so don't get into a flap! The best way to learn is just to try equipping your familiars.
<REACTION>But don't feel left out, will you? Humans can, of cawse, <color:#1>equip</color> items, too.
Select <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color> and press [btn_ok] to change the items you have equipped.
Caw! Why not buy a nice matching set of items for you and your familiars? Birds of a feather stick together,<NL>after all!
Now, Master, it seems you are still in need of instruction concerning the use of the <color:#1>cauldron</color>. There are two ways<NL>to alchemize.
<REACTION>When you possess the alchemical formula of the item you desire, simply select <color:#1>Follow the Formula</color> and you shall have it in an instant!
<REACTION>But should you not possess the formula, you<NL>may select <color:#1>Mix and Match</color> to combine ingredients<NL>to your heart's content!
I pray you will produce most wondrous and magical results, Master!
For your first steps on the path of the alchemist, I recommend that you follow a formula. Do not run before you can walk, Master!
Now boy, you can press [btn_squ] at any time to open your <color:#1>Spells Menu</color>.
While a spell like <color:#8>Healing Touch</color> can be used at any time, <color:#8>Fireball</color> is meant primarily for use in battle.
That said, the most unexpected of spells can prove incomparably useful given the right set of circumstances. Novel problems call for novel solutions, after all.
If you find yourself at something of a loss, I recommend that you go through your magical repertoire. You never know which spell might save the day!
Now listen up! I'm going to teach you what's what in that <color:#1>Wizard's Companion</color> of youers.
If you want to have a read of it, press [btn_tri] to open the <color:#1>Main Menu</color>.
You should see it down at the bottom right of there. Then you just need to choose it with [btn_ok] and you can leaf through the Wizard's Companion to youer heart's content!
Take a minute or two to have a skim of a few pages, eh? You look like a smart lad, so I'm sure you'll soon get into it.
Oh, I almost forgot! The first thing you have to do when you get youer hands on the Wizard's Companion is to make a pledge!
You need to vow that you'll do all you can do to be worthy of being a wizard.
Don't look so flipping worried! It's not hard! All you have to do is to <color:#1>write youer name in the book</color> with an open, honest heart!
And you don't even have to write "Oliver" if you don't want. You can write "Bunting," "Cry-Baby," or whatever you like. The important thing is that you mean it.
Go on! Scribble youer name down!
In the Creature Cage, you can shower youer faithful familiars with delicious <color:#1>treats</color>.
There's all kinds of treats to choose from. Some will <color:#1>improve their abilities</color>, and there's other ones that can even <color:#1>teach them new tricks</color>! Tidy!
Feed the little blighters enough of what they fancy, and the bonds of <color:#1>familiarity</color> between you will grow, meaning you can boost their abilities even more!
Careful not to stuff them too full of sweeties, though—they'll only end up getting <color:#1>full up</color>. Adoration in moderation, that's the key!
It's probably a lot to get youer head around, but just remember that the Creature Cage is where you look after youer familiars, and take it from there, en't it.
Don't be stupid! That's the <color:#1>rep from the Familiar Retreat</color>!
<NL>He'll take any familiars you don't need off your hands and keep them safe back at the Retreat.
When familiars <color:#1>metamorphose</color>, they get stronger, look different, and learn better tricks.
They also get to gobble up more gems, meaning you can teach them even more tricks!
The <color:#1>treat</color> you need to feed to a familiar to make it metamorphose depends on its sign—something you never would have worked out on your own.
Oh, and here's another piece of priceless wisdom you don't deserve: <color:#1>when familiars metamorphose, they go back to level one</color>.
But that doesn't mean you're back to square one. Once you train them up, they'll be much more powerful than they were before.
Whether you metamorphose your familiars or not is up to you. Some idiots prefer to stick with what they've got. Do what you want. I don't care.
Folks who are in need of assistance flock to me, hoping to find someone willing to take on their <color:#1>errands</color> for them.
On your travels, you're bound to run into people who are looking for help.
And you'll have to decide whether or not to soothe their fluttering hearts by taking on the tasks they set you.
Have a look at the <color:#1>Errand Board</color> over there.<NL>On it, you'll see a list of the tasks you can take on.
<REACTION>At Swift Solutions, you can also agree to undertake missions to eliminate specific monsters.<NL>These are known as <color:#1>bounty hunts</color>.
If you want to find out more, access the Main Menu, and take a look in your <color:#1>Journal</color>.
Keep this <color:#1>merit stamp card</color> safe. You'll need it to collect stamps when you complete tasks.
Once you've filled up a few cards, you can exchange them for <color:#1>merit awards</color>, which are sure to be useful on your travels.
Simply visit the nearest branch of <color:#1>Swift Solutions</color>, hand over your completed cards, and the awards will be yours!
Ah, the scent of the sea stirs my soul!<NL>Now, friends, do you know how to steer a ship?
Ha ha! Fear not! There is no mystery to it. Navigate with [stk_l] and use [stk_r] to change your viewpoint. You will master it before long, I am sure.
Should you wish to disembark, <color:#1>head to shore</color> and<NL>press [btn_ok].
Then, when you wish to take to the high seas once more, <color:#1>approach the ship</color> and press [btn_ok] to come aboard.
Our destination is the far-flung continent of Autumnia, to the northeast of here. That is where you shall find Hamelin.
If you should lose your bearings on the open ocean, the <color:#1>world map</color> will prove a trusty companion.
Press [btn_r1] whilst aboard the Sea Cow to consult it.<NL>When you are not aboard the ship, meanwhile, press<NL>[btn_r1] to open the local map, then press [btn_tri].
With the aid of such a map, there can be no excuse for becoming lost!
Flipping Nora! Is this high enough for you, Ollie-boy?
Righto! Since the smallest mistake up here will result in certain death, I reckon now's a good time to give you Captain Drippy's Don't-Crash Course in Dragon Flying!
Don't worry, mun! If you survive the first five minutes, there's nothing to it! You just change directions with [stk_l] and use [stk_r] to have a good look around, en't it?
Oh, and when you want to plonk youer feet back on solid ground, press [btn_ok]. You'll see a <color:#1>circle</color> appear.
Use [stk_l] to shift the circle to where you want it, then press [btn_ok] to land on that spot. If you change youer mind and want to carry on flying, press [btn_can].
Just be sure to watch the color of the circle. If it's <color:#1>blue</color>, youer all right to land, but if it's <color:#1>red</color>, you'll have to find somewhere else.
Once you've had enough of being back on the boring old ground, honk on that <color:#1>dragon horn</color> Pirateface gave you, and Tengri will come flapping.
Just press [key_u] and you'll give it a good old parp. But enough of my yabbering—let's enjoy a dragon's-eye view of the world, eh!?
“Dearest Oliver,<NL>I trust you are well. I wanted you to know how grateful I am to you for coming to see my world.
“By way of thanks, I have decided to make an old dream of yours come true... I present to you the <color:#1>Philmobile 2000</color>!
“I am sure you can't wait to get behind the wheel, so here's what you need to know: you <color:#1>steer</color> with [stk_l], and...that's about it!
“I daresay you'll find it a little different to the other modes of transport you've used, but I'm sure you'll pick it up in no time at all.
“Whenever you want to take it for a spin, use the <color:#1>Philmobile key</color>, or press [key_d]. And whenever you want to hop out, just press [btn_ok].
“Now it's time for you to hit the open road! Drive safe!<NL>Your friend,<NL>The Conductor”
Allow me to give you a c-c-crash c-c-course in the fundamentals of the <color:#1>slots</color>.
<REACTION>The basic-c-c idea in slots is to line up symbols either horizontally or diagonally.
You wager a certain number of chips, and depending on the <color:#1>c-c-combination</color> of symbols you get, the amount you stand to win will vary.
<REACTION>If the symbols match, the <color:#1>Chance Meter</color> will fill.
<REACTION>And when the Chance Meter is full, the machine will enter <color:#1>Mega Mode</color>.
In Mega Mode, you stand to win double the amount each c-c-c-combination would normally bag you.
<REACTION>You c-c-can change the amount you are betting on each spin at any point using [key_lr]. It's up to you when you want to adjust your stake.
<REACTION>All k-k-k-kinds of <color:#1>items</color> will mak-k-k-ke appearances during the game, and you will be able to use them at more or less any point.
Use [btn_l1] and [btn_r1] to selec-c-ct an item, and press [btn_squ] to use it.
<REACTION>Items have a range of effec-c-cts, from slowing down time to boosting the Chance Meter.
Just bear in mind that you c-c-can only have a maximum of three items at any one time.
So don't be afraid to use the items you get.<NL>It will mak-k-k-ke space for more!
<REACTION>I should mention at this point that not all items have helpful effects—for example there is one that speeds up time.
These items are used automatic-c-cally as soon as you c-c-collect them, so be aware!
Now, tak-k-ke your time, and most importantly, enjoy yourself! Mwahahaha!
I'm going to take you through the basics of <color:#1>Blackjack</color>, so clean out your ears!
In Blackjack, you compete with the dealer to see whose cards have a total closest to <color:#1>twenty-one</color>.
Face cards—that's jacks, queens, and kings—are worth ten, while aces can either be one or eleven. The other cards are worth their face value.
<REACTION>At the start of a game, I will deal us both two cards.
In the example above, your cards total fourteen, which is a long way from twenty-one. At times like that, you should ask to be dealt another card.
<REACTION>If you want another card, select <NL><color:#1>Hit</color> and press [btn_ok].
<REACTION>In the example above, you've been dealt another card, and your total is now seventeen.
The important thing is not to get greedy and keep asking for more cards.
If your total exceeds twenty-one, you'll go <color:#1>bust</color> and lose the game.
<REACTION>If you're happy with your total and want to compare it to the dealer's hand, select <color:#1>Stand</color>.
<REACTION>The dealer's cards will then be revealed, and the hand nearest to twenty-one will win.
If you manage to get a total of precisely twenty-one, that's called <color:#1>Blackjack</color>.
You'll always win with a Blackjack, unless your opponent matches it.
Right, that's quite enough explanation for now!<NL>Let's give it a go, shall we? I hope you were listening!
Pay attention as I take you through the rules of Platoon.
<REACTION>In Platoon, you're dealt a total of ten cards, from which you form five units. You'll then use these units to—ahem—do battle!
<REACTION>I think it's easiest if I start by telling you about the two different types of card: <color:#1>regular cards</color> and <color:#1>special cards</color>.
Regular cards are those <color:#1>from the two to the queen</color>. These are called <color:#1>pawns</color>.
The cards from two to nine are worth their face value, while the ten, jack, and queen are each worth ten.
<color:#1>Special cards</color>, meanwhile, come in three varieties: kings, bishops, and wizards.
The important thing to say about <color:#1>kings</color> is that if you have one in your unit, <color:#1>you will always win</color>, regardless of the unit's total value.
But if there are two units facing each other, both of which contain a king, the unit with the highest total value of regular cards will win.
The <color:#1>bishop</color> has the opposite effect, and any unit that contains one <color:#1>will lose</color>.
However, there is one exception to this rule: when the opposing unit contains a king, <color:#1>a unit containing a bishop will win</color>.
If two units containing bishops face each other, the one with the highest value of regular cards will win, much like when two units with kings do battle.
Finally, let's turn to the <color:#1>wizard</color>.
Wizard cards <color:#1>swap your unit with that of your opponent</color>.
Just be aware that you cannot have a unit composed solely of a wizard—and that wizard cards have a value of zero.
The maximum number of special cards that can be included in a single unit is two.
In addition, you cannot include a king and a bishop in the same unit. Are you with me so far?
<REACTION>Now, I'm going to give you a demonstration of how to divide the ten cards you've been dealt into five units.
To put together your units' <color:#1>formation</color>, first select a card, then choose a slot for it.
<REACTION>Think carefully about whether you wish to form units with high values, or make good tactical use of special cards.
<REACTION>Once you've formed your five units, it's time to<NL><color:#1>predict a victor</color>!
This is where you place a <color:#1>mark</color> on a unit that you think is going to emerge victorious.
If you have doubts about the strength of your own hand, you can put a mark on an opposing unit.
If your prediction proves correct, you'll receive a bonus of half your original wager on top of your winnings.
<REACTION>Once you've predicted a victor, the next step is to decide who will go first.
Each player will draw a card from the deck, and the player with the highest card will go first.
<REACTION>With all the preliminaries taken care of, it will then be time to let battle commence!
The player who starts will choose one of their own units, and the unit they wish to do battle with.
<REACTION>The two units will then be revealed, and victory will go to the one with the highest value.
Should special cards be involved, the winner will be determined according to the rules I described earlier.
Each player will then take it in turns to select units to send into battle, and the first player to register three victories will be declared the winner.
Did you get all of that? I know it sounds a little complicated, but if you give it a whirl, you'll soon get into the swing of things.
Now, let's see if you've got what it takes to win!
Ready to learn the rules of <color:#1>Double Cross</color>, the ultimate test of twoness?
<REACTION>Both you and Esther will be put to the test as you traverse a perilous collapsing walkway and try to make it to the other side without falling off.
<REACTION>Before getting started, you'll get to choose the stage you want to try.
There are more <color:#1>chips on offer</color> if you're willing to risk one of the more dangerous stages.
<REACTION>Once you've selected a stage, it'll be time for you to run the gauntlet. You move using [stk_l], while Esther uses [stk_r].
Stand on the two <color:#1>switches</color>, and panels will appear, which can be used to cross the pit.
<REACTION>The panels will collapse in sequence, beginning with those nearest the start. This means there really isn't a lot of time for deliberation. Keep moving!
The speed at which the panels collapse will vary depending on the stage selected.
<REACTION>Partway across each pit, there will be a <color:#1>rest stop</color> where you can catch your breath.
When you're ready to continue, stand on the two switches to create a path, just as you did at the start.
To complete the challenge, you must both reach the goal and step on the switches there.
Now, I don't want to jinx you, but I really must tell you about <color:#1>failing the challenge</color>.
<REACTION>If either you or Esther should take a tumble, the game is over, and you will lose your stake.
If you don't keep your wits about you, this challenge can be over in a matter of moments, so stay sharp!
That's all I've got to say for now. Try to enjoy yourself out there. And be safe!
So, my young friends, it seems you wish to learn more about the fundamental and indispensable skills of ambulation and conversation!
Let us turn first to the methodology of <color:#1>moving</color>. Simply tilt [stk_l] on that controller of yours and you will proceed in the desired direction.
Tilt [stk_l] slightly to amble at a leisurely <color:#1>walking pace</color>, or tilt it further to <color:#1>run like the wind</color>!
<REACTION>Let us turn now to the gentle art of conversation. Approach a gregarious-looking sort and a [ico_tlk] will appear above his head. Press [btn_ok] to speak to him.
If you bear my words in mind, you should have no trouble making your way in the world, and getting to know all manner of new people.
Let me share a little of my prodigious knowledge on the subject of changing viewpoints with you.
Use [stk_r] on the controller to adjust the<NL><color:#1>viewpoint</color> freely.
When you're in a town or dungeon, you can take advantage of a first-person perspective by pressing [btn_r3].
By mastering the manipulation of viewpoints, you'll be able to take in every element of this wonderful world.
That's all I have to say on this particular subject. But if there is anything else you wish to know, you need only ask.
No young adventurer can afford to remain ignorant as to the intricacies of the mini map and the local map. Allow me to enlighten you.
You have no doubt spotted the diminutive map in the top-right corner of the screen. This is the <color:#1>mini map</color>.
This shows the area in your immediate vicinity.
By pressing [btn_r1], you can switch to the bird's-eye view of the wider area offered by the <color:#1>local map</color>.
Your next destination is usefully displayed on both mini and local maps with a [ico_nxt]. When you are at a loss as to what to do next, consult your maps.
Now, I trust you are feeling significantly more knowledgeable than you were before. Until next time!
I shall now endeavor to impress on you the supreme importance of saving your game.
<color:#1>Saving</color> your game means making a record of your journey so far, enabling you to pick up your adventure again by selecting <color:#1>Continue</color> on the title screen.
When you are in towns, or traveling in the field, you can save your game by accessing the <color:#1>Main Menu</color> and pressing [btn_sta].
Remember—"to spare yourself much trouble and strife,<NL>save your game and save your life!"<NL>My own composition, I should add...
Now, if there is anyone in this world better qualified than me to wax lyrical about waystones, I would very much like to meet them.
<color:#1>Waystones</color> are the mysterious stones you will come across in forests, caves, and other out-of-the-way places.
Simply touching one of these stones will miraculously <color:#1>restore all your HP and MP</color>.
But that is not all! These marvelous monoliths will also allow you to <color:#1>save your game</color>.
A wise adventurer always saves his game at a waystone prior to confronting powerful adversaries.
Ah... I could talk about those wonderful stones all day long, but I fear your patience would wear thin.<NL>Let us leave this life lesson there, shall we?
There's no getting around it. From time to time, you are going to encounter less than friendly magical creatures, and you need to be prepared.
There are all manner of <color:#1>magical creatures</color> who call this world their home.
When they become aware of your presence, a [ico_hit] will appear above their heads, and they will give chase.
Battle will commence when they close to within touching distance. You can try to evade them, of course, but for gaining experience, there is no substitute for a good fight.
Oh, but be aware that you can gain the upper hand in battle by approaching monsters from behind. If they fail to notice you, you will have the honor of the first strike!
But it also works the other way round, as is the way of the world. If a monster sneaks up on you, it will be able to strike first.
I wish you well out there on the field of battle!
Let me share a little of my wisdom with you on the subject of giving and taking hearts.
The only way to cure the <color:#1>brokenhearted</color> is to share a <color:#1>piece of heart</color> from one who has an abundance of a particular virtue.
Should someone prove willing to share it with you, you may pocket a piece of heart with the <color:#8>Take Heart</color> spell.
This piece of heart will be safely stored in the <color:#1>Locket</color>, fashioned by my boon companion, Old Father Oak.
<REACTION>In order to pass pieces of heart on to the poor unfortunates who have had their hearts broken, you must use <color:#8>Give Heart</color>.
After casting <color:#8>Give Heart</color>, you will need to select the <color:#1>piece of heart</color> you wish to share.
Well, young friend, I trust you are now suitably enlightened on the aforementioned matters of the heart.
Let me now expound on the fascinating subject of what it signifies when one's Locket glows.
The <color:#1>Locket</color> is not merely a receptacle for pieces of heart. Oh no!
As you go about your business, it will spontaneously glow upon occasion.
The <color:#1>Locket</color> is responding to the presence of one who has an abundance of one virtue or another.
Such souls will also be highlighted on the mini map<NL>at the top right of the screen. Look out for glowing<NL>spots thereon.
I trust you enjoyed my unlocking of some of the mysteries of the marvelous Locket. I look forward to speaking to you again soon.
Ah, so you wish to learn more about opening treasure chests with the pickpocket's pistol, do you?
Well, your wish is my command! You will come across rather inaccessible <color:#1>green chests</color> as you make your way around towns and dungeons.
This is when your colleague Swaine can really come into his own.
With the green chest firmly within eyeshot, Swaine can press [btn_ok] to pull out the <color:#1>pickpocket's pistol</color>.
He will then take aim using [stk_r] and press [btn_ok] to fire a shot at the aforementioned treasure receptacle, securing its contents in so doing!
I trust you will be able to utilize this lesson for both fun and profit. Good luck!
Allow me to enlighten you on the fascinating subject of the Main Menu.
As you wander the world, a simple press of [btn_tri] will render the majesty of the <color:#1>Main Menu</color> plain to sight.
Within this menu, a whole host of marvelous options veritably clamor for your attention.
Select your area of interest with [key_all] and press [btn_ok]. Press [btn_can] to go back to the Main Menu, and press it again to exit the Main Menu altogether.
<REACTION>I shall speak at length about each of the options in the Main Menu at another juncture.
For now, enjoy familiarizing yourself with its content and layout.
So you wish to learn more about the workings of your Bottomless Bag? Well, let's see if we can't...get to the bottom of this, so to speak! Ho ho!
From the <color:#1>Main Menu</color>, select <color:#1>Bottomless Bag</color> to inspect the full array of items you have managed to acquire.
Items are divided into different categories, and you can use [btn_l1] and [btn_r1] to switch between them as you please.
<color:#1>Consumable items</color> can be used there and then by pressing [btn_ok]—ideal for restoring sorely needed HP and MP.
Now, that's enough of my lecturing for the time being.<NL>I very much look forward to speaking to you again soon.
Ah, this is an interesting topic! How does one go about finding out more about the abilities of their closest companions?
Well, your first port of call is the trusty Main Menu.<NL>From there, select <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color> to peruse a panoply of information about your party.
Let us begin with <color:#4>HP (Health Points)</color>. This field indicates physical stamina, while the field marked <color:#5>MP (Magic Points)</color> shows the magical power at the subject's disposal.
<color:#1>Movement Speed</color> and <color:#1>Attack Speed</color> are self-explanatory,<NL>I would have thought. The more ★ you have, the faster<NL>you are.
<color:#1>Attack</color> determines the damage inflicted by physical attacks, while <color:#1>Defense</color> influences the degree of<NL>damage taken.
<color:#1>Magical Attack</color> and <color:#1>Magical Defense</color>, meanwhile, both relate to damage inflicted by—yes—magical attacks.
<color:#1>Evasion</color> indicates the chances of sidestepping an attack, while <color:#1>Accuracy</color> determines how likely your blows are to find their target.
Oh, and I almost forgot something rather important!<NL><color:#1>Exp.</color> indicates the level of experience you have attained through battle.
Your <color:#1>level will increase</color> as you gain experience. <color:#1>Exp. to Next Level</color> lets you know how far you have to go until the next step up.
If you would like to hear any of this again, I am more than happy to repeat myself.
But I'll leave this lesson here for the time being.
Now, let us turn to the subject of assigning commands and tricks to your companions.
The skills learned by creatures are known as <color:#1>tricks</color>.
You can see the various tricks and abilities possessed by your party by selecting <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color> from the<NL><color:#1>Main Menu</color>.
Just bear in mind that tricks are somewhat different from spells in that a trick occupies a single command slot.
This means that even if a studious familiar learns all manner of tricks, the number they can use at the same<NL>time is limited.
If a familiar has a generous number of tricks to its name, press [btn_tri] to <color:#1>select the tricks</color> that familiar can use in battle.
Oh, and never forget that familiars can only remember a <color:#1>maximum of eight tricks</color>.
If they have learned their full allotment, and you wish them to learn a new trick, you will have to ask them to forget one of their old ones.
Oh, and on this screen, you can see the tricks your familiars will learn as they increase their level.<NL>This should serve to spur you on to greater things.
Ah, it's such a fascinating subject. I could happily while away the day discussing it, but I am aware you have important things to be getting on with. Good day!
Today's life lesson concerns assembling an unbeatable team from the allies at your disposal.
When new comrades join your cause, both they and any familiars they may possess will fight alongside you.
You can even swap your allies' familiars between you.
Meaning that you can control Esther's familiar, and vice versa, should you so choose.
Select <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color> from the <color:#1>Main Menu</color>, choose a familiar and press [btn_squ] to assign it to a different keeper.
When you are swapping round familiars, bear in mind that each ally is <color:#1>better suited to handling creatures of certain genuses</color>.
When your allies and their familiars are in harmony, their familiars' strengths will come to the fore.
You can find out which genuses each ally handles best by accessing Friends &amp; Familiars.
Ah, I enjoyed that. It's always a pleasure to share a little of my wisdom. I have a near limitless supply, you know!
Select <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color> from the <color:#1>Main Menu</color>, choose a familiar and press [btn_squ] to change its position.
...Oh! I forgot to mention that this doesn't just apply to familiars. You can do the same with your human companions, too.
When reorganizing your forces, bear in mind that each ally is <color:#1>better suited to handling creatures of certain genuses</color>.
Let us turn now to the issue of equipping your friends and familiars.
If you wish to turn your familiars into a formidable fighting force, you will need to equip them with the necessary tools.
Each familiar can be equipped with up to three different items.
These items fall into three different categories—<color:#1>weapons, armor, and accessories</color>. Note that a familiar may only equip one item from each category.
And that the specific items it can equip will depend on<NL>its genus.
<REACTION>Naturally, humans such as yourself can also <color:#1>equip</color> items to boost your capabilities.
However, you can only change <color:#1>weapons—or wand, in your case—and accessories</color>.
So do not focus solely on outfitting your familiars for war. You must ensure that you and your human comrades are suitably prepared, too.
Check what your party currently has equipped by selecting <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color> from the Main Menu and pressing [btn_ok].
Now, my young friend, I hope you are walking away a wiser person. I look forward to speaking to you again.
Let us turn now to the arcane mysteries of alchemy, one of my very favorite topics.
By mixing complex combinations of ingredients in the <color:#1>cauldron</color>, you can create new items.
There are two routes to alchemical success.<NL>Let's look at them both in turn.
<REACTION>If you possess the required formulae, simply select <color:#1>Follow the Formula</color> and your items will be ready in a flash.
<REACTION>More daring souls can make do without a formula by selecting <color:#1>Mix and Match</color>, and combining ingredients as they please.
Simply select ingredients to pop in the cauldron with [btn_ok] and press [btn_squ] to stir them up.
Should your experimental mixings result in a mishap, fear not! It will not use up your ingredients.
That's all for this lesson. When next you wish to steep yourself in timeless wisdom, do not hesitate to call!
Let us turn now to your Creature Compendium.
Whenever you defeat a monster, or add it to your ranks as a familiar, it will be entered in your <color:#1>Creature Compendium</color>.
You will find that this tome is full to bursting with exciting information, such as creatures' tricks, their vulnerable points, and the items they drop.
You can also sort the creatures contained within into categories based on their name, genus, or habitat.
If there is a creature you've set your heart on recruiting to your cause, I recommend you make full use of this feature.
So, have fun as you hunt for further subjects to add to your compendium!
Let us turn now to the list of perilous and petrifying places you have chanced to visit on your adventure.
I speak, of course, of your record of <color:#1>Dangerous Places</color>.
Here you can relive the terrors you faced by perusing maps and seeing the monsters with whom you were forced to contend.
You will also be able to see how much of the area you explored, and the number of treasure chests concealed within.
Have fun delving into those dangerous places you have seen and conquered.
This lesson will be of great interest to a budding wizard such as yourself, concerning as it does a certain mighty spellbook.
Select <color:#1>Wizard's Companion</color> from the <color:#1>Main Menu</color>, and lose yourself amidst the myriad wonders contained therein.
Much more than magic spells await between those ancient covers, you know. The tome brims with fascinating details about this world.
There is, however, a slight snag. Your copy of the Wizard's Companion <color:#1>is missing rather a lot of pages</color>, you see.
One of your goals during your journey is to <color:#1>find those missing pages</color>, and complete your spellbook.
Give your Wizard's Companion a look. You will find that it really is the most marvelous page-turner.
Allow me to impart a little of my limitless knowledge on the subject of magical mastery.
When you are on your travels, pressing [btn_squ] will open your <color:#1>Spells Menu</color>.
Here, you can use [btn_l1] and [btn_r1] to select the category of spells. If your chosen spell can be used at that moment, pressing [btn_ok] will let you <color:#1>cast</color> it.
Many of the spells cannot be used as and when you like, but there are those spells for all seasons, such as <color:#8>Healing Touch</color>, which you can use at any point.
Should a [ico_naz] symbol appear anywhere, try out a variety of spells to see what effect they may have.
I wish you the very best of luck in becoming a true master of magic.
So you wish to know more about training up your familiars, do you? I am only too happy to oblige!
Access your <color:#1>Creature Cage</color> from the Main Menu and you can train up your collection of familiars.
Well, I say "train." Perhaps "pamper" would be a better word, for in the Creature Cage, you can lavish your nearest and dearest familiars with all manner of tasty <color:#1>treats</color>.
These treats have various effects, such as <color:#1>boosting abilities</color> or helping familiars to <color:#1>learn new tricks</color>.
Judicious use of treats will serve to boost the level of <color:#1>familiarity</color> between you and your charges.
As familiarity increases, it will have the effect of <color:#1>increasing the maximum level</color> to which abilities can be boosted.
The more attention you devote to your collection of familiars, the more fiercely their sense of loyalty towards their masters will burn.
You will see this reflected in their <color:#1>selfless desire to shield you</color> from enemy attacks in battle.
Now, it must be said that it is rather rare for familiars to shield you of their own volition, but the higher your levels of familiarity, the more likely it is to occur.
But in pursuit of the ultimate familiar fighting force, do not be tempted to ply your pals with excess treats, for they will <color:#1>get full</color>, and stop eating.
...Only for a time, of course. After a bit of exercise—<color:#1>taking part in a strenuous battle</color> or two, say—their appetite will return with a vengeance!
And so ends today's lesson on training up your faithful familiars.
So it seems you wish to learn more about creatures' signs. Well, make yourself comfortable, and I shall begin...
Each and every creature in this world has a <color:#1>sign</color> denoting its alignment with one of four celestial bodies.
These are: the sun, the moon, the star, and the planet.
Should two otherwise identical creatures have different signs, they will each behave somewhat differently.
Such differences reveal themselves most starkly when creatures interact with one another. Each sign has a given relationship with its counterparts, you see.
Sun is stronger than moon, but vulnerable to star.<NL>Star is stronger than sun, but vulnerable to moon.<NL>Moon is stronger than star, but vulnerable to sun.
Of course, the planet sign is a little different...<NL>But I can see that I am in danger of losing you. The point is that it is worth bearing signs in mind during battle.
And with that, I shall bring this lesson to a close. I trust you feel suitably enlightened.
So you wish to learn more about the Familiar Retreat, do you? Allow me to enlighten you.
You and your companions can each keep three familiars with you, and <color:#1>up to three more may be kept in reserve in the Creature Cage</color>.
But as you add more familiars to your ranks, you will soon find that space becomes rather tight. This is where the <color:#1>Familiar Retreat</color> comes in.
Simply hand over any familiars you'd like to house to the Retreat representative, and they will be well looked after.
If you subsequently wish one of your charges to rejoin you, you can simply collect them from the Retreat.
Should the Creature Cage be at full capacity, the Familiar Retreat representative will automatically collect newly befriended familiars if you so wish.
You will find Familiar Retreats dotted around towns, or beside waystones. Do be sure to make full use of these marvelous facilities.
Now, I feel have I have imparted an elegant sufficiency of knowledge on this topic. Let us leave it there, shall we?
Ah, it seems you are filled with desire to add familiars to your ranks. Well, I am only too glad to tell you how to go about it.
During battle, you will sometimes see <color:#1>hearts</color> fluttering about an all but vanquished creature's head.
When a creature is in this state, Esther can make use of her [cnd_love] command.
She can then select <color:#1>Serenade</color> to attempt to win said creature's heart. Should she subsequently change her mind, she can <color:#1>Stop Serenading</color> at any time.
<NL>If Esther is successful in charming the love-struck creature, it will be <color:#1>added to your ranks</color> after the battle.
Just be aware that while you may all be equally qualified to vanquish creatures, only Esther has the ability to build bridges with them, and win them over to your cause.
There! That is all the wisdom I wish to impart on this topic for now!
Allow me to expound on the miracle of metamorphosis!
When your familiars have matured to a certain point, they will be ready to <color:#1>metamorphose</color>.
In order to initiate this process, familiars must be fed special <color:#1>treats</color> in the <color:#1>Creature Cage</color>.
Now, the precise treat required will vary depending on the familiar's <color:#1>sign</color>.
When a familiar metamorphoses, its appearance and abilities will change. It may also be able to pick up some powerful new tricks.
Its palette may also broaden, allowing it to consume different kinds of gems. As you may have deduced, this means that it will be able to learn more tricks.
But before we get carried away by the wonders of metamorphosis, it would be remiss of me not to mention that <color:#1>your familiar's level will go back to one</color>!
Once a familiar is capable of metamorphosis, you can set the process in motion at any point. It's entirely up to you whether or not you decide to go through with it.
Though I could go on, I think I shall leave it at that for the moment. Private contemplation is a large part of learning, after all.
So you wish to learn more about the basics of battle?
Firstly, it is wise to always keep an eye on your levels of <color:#1>HP</color> and <color:#1>MP</color>, which are displayed on the left of the screen.
HP represent your physical health, while MP indicate your magical power. Should your HP reach zero, you will suffer the gross indignity of <color:#1>losing consciousness</color>.
<REACTION>When facing monsters in battle, your starting point should be understanding the various <color:#1>commands in the speech bubbles</color>.
It really isn't very difficult to grasp. Select an action with [key_lr] and press [btn_ok] to perform it.
<REACTION>Oh, and be aware that even if you've bumped into a seemingly solitary monster, you may be faced by further foes when the battle begins.
At such times, you can select the enemy you wish to strike and press [btn_r1] to show them what for.
You will see useful information about the foes you are facing at the top right of the screen.
I wish you luck in mastering the basics of battle.
I would recommend getting into the habit of using [key_ud] to switch smoothly between yourself and your familiars.
The creatures of this world can be rather fierce, but if you master the basics, and adopt an appropriate strategy, you should be able to hold your own in battle.
A rather clever tactic is to strike just before a foe unleashes a trick. Time it right and the attack will fail.
This is known as <color:#1>cancelling an action</color>. Yes, attack can be the surest form of defense, after all!
Now, let me teach you the art of <color:#1>cancelling foes' actions</color>. Do this by selecting <color:#1>Attack</color> and striking just as an enemy unleashes a trick.
If you time it to perfection, the enemy will be left flummoxed, and the trick will never materialize. Yes, attack can be the surest form of defense, after all!
Another technique more suited to veteran battlers is the <color:#1>counterattack</color>.
Upon occasion, the <color:#1>Attack</color> command displayed in the speech bubble will <color:#1>flash blue</color> just before an enemy attacks.
Press the [btn_ok] at that exact instant to launch your counterattack. Time it right, and you will leave your opponent reeling and unable to act.
Master these techniques, as they are bound to come in useful when you face mightier foes.
Good luck out there on the field of battle!
Now, let us speak of glims, and how to use them to your advantage in battle.
I should clarify that <color:#1>glims</color> are the shining spheres dropped by enemies during battles.
When you grab a glim, it can have a number of effects. Green glims will restore HP, while blue ones will top up your magic power.
Glims come in other varieties too. Pick them up in battle and see what they do.
Glims are more likely to appear when you earn an acclamation of "<color:#1>Nice!</color>" during a battle. But bear in<NL>mind that they vanish after a while.
Now, I do hope that I have managed to shed some light on the subject of glims. Until next time!
Let us now discuss gold glims and Miracle Moves.
The most radiant stars in the constellation of glims are known as <color:#1>gold glims</color>.
Catch one as it floats gently down to the ground, and <color:#1>your HP will be fully restored</color>!
<REACTION>But that's not all! You will also be able to unleash a <color:#1>Miracle Move</color>—an incredible technique that can turn the tide of battle in an instant!
Better still, Miracle Moves do not consume any of your precious magic power! In short: if you see a gold glim in battle, make a beeline for it!
I think that I've expounded enough on this particular topic for now. I trust I shall speak with you again before very long.
Now, let us turn to the thorny issue of running away from a fight.
When you are facing overwhelming odds, or perilously low on HP, beating a hasty retreat may be the only sensible option.
At such times, select <color:#1>Run Away</color> from among your speech bubble commands.
Even if you fail at first, keep trying to run away and you should eventually be able to make your escape. Be aware, however, that there are battles from which you cannot flee.
Now, I think I've said enough. If you wish to practice by running away, feel free!
In life, one will experience both triumph and defeat.<NL>Let us now discuss what to do when you lose a battle.
Should every party member's HP be reduced to zero, you will be <color:#1>defeated</color>.
You will be down, but not out. Select <color:#1>Continue</color> and you can restart from a point just before the battle.
Though you will lose some of your money, your HP and MP will be fully restored.
Of course, if you keep falling in battle, you may need to rethink your approach.
It's a painful subject, but I'm glad you took the time to hear me speak about defeat.
Our next life lesson looks at the use of familiars in battle.
Your faithful <color:#1>familiars</color> can fight in your stead.
Before battles begin, you can select the familiars who will fight by your side. You can then switch to one of these familiars using [btn_l1] during battle.
Your party's human members <color:#1>share their HP and MP</color> with their familiars.
For example, if your familiar is hit, your <color:#4>HP</color> will decrease, and should that familiar use a trick, your <color:#5>MP</color> will be depleted.
<REACTION>The other thing to be aware of is your familiar's <color:#1>stamina gauge</color> which will go down during the battle.
When this stamina gauge is empty, your familiar will be too exhausted to fight effectively.
Before things reach that point, you should remove your familiar from the fray, and permit them time to recover.
I trust you are now suitably enlightened.
Let us now discuss switching between familiars<NL>during battle.
You can go into battle with up to three familiars in<NL>your ranks.
Bear in mind, however, that you can only control one familiar at any one time. Any more than that would lead to chaos, as I'm sure you can imagine.
Should you wish to send a different familiar into the fray, you are free to switch between your squad in the midst<NL>of battle.
It's done in the same way as you yourself would switch places with one of your familiars—press [btn_l1] and then press [key_lr] to confirm your choice.
Deft switching between members of your party can be used to your advantage in battle.
I trust that you have emerged from this lesson a little more enlightened than you were.
So you wish to learn more about changing leaders during battle, do you? I will do all I can to oblige.
In battle, your allies will act according to their own judgment.
But when you wish to direct your allies yourself, you can switch between <color:#1>leaders</color>.
It's done in a similar manner to switching between familiars. Press [btn_l1] during battle, and use [key_ud] to select a new leader.
I trust you will put what I have taught you to gainful use in battle.
Let us turn now to the subject of ailments.
Certain creatures are capable of performing attacks with effects that linger after the moment of impact.<NL>For example, some can <color:#1>poison</color> their foes.
If you are unfortunate enough to find yourself poisoned, your HP will steadily decrease, so reach for some poison-be-gone as soon as you can.
When one is poisoned, one is suffering from what is known as an <color:#1>ailment</color>. And sadly, there are a fair few besides poison, so be on your guard.
I trust that this knowledge will serve you well!
So you wish me to enlighten you on the subject of affinities and resistance? Why, I would be delighted!
Certain tricks and magic spells derive their power from forces with which creatures share an affinity.
They fall into six categories: fire, water, storm, light, darkness, and physical attacks. Naturally, a spell like <color:#8>Fireball</color> derives its power from—yes—fire.
Now, by virtue of their affinities, most creatures have an in-built <color:#1>resistance</color> to certain forces.
Put simply, those attacks which share the same affinity as the creature in question will prove woefully ineffective when used against them.
I hope that has made things somewhat clearer.
Let us turn now to vital leadership skills—making tactical decisions and issuing orders to your troops.
Have you ever felt the desire to give instructions to the allies fighting alongside you?
Well, the next time you get this urge, select the speech bubble command that reads <color:#1>Tactics</color>.
You can indicate the sort of approach you want your comrades to take in the heat of battle.
If you are ever struggling against a formidable foe, tweaking your tactics may help turn the tide.
Now, be sure to remember all that I have told you today. That's an order!
Now, should you deem it necessary to make a dramatic tactical about-turn, two options are open to you.
If the time is ripe to launch an <color:#1>all-out attack</color>, press [btn_tri] to prompt your allies to go for the jugular.
If a foe has you on the proverbial ropes, meanwhile, you can adopt a strategy of all-out defense by pressing [btn_squ].
Allow me to shed some light on the subject of tasks.
As a helpful soul, you will no doubt be eager to volunteer for charitable <color:#1>tasks</color>. These fall into two main categories. The first entails running <color:#1>errands</color> for people.
Completing such errands not only improves the lives of troubled souls, but can prove materially rewarding as well.
You will receive errands direct from people, or find them on the <color:#1>Errand Board in Swift Solutions</color>.<NL>Be sure to check regularly.
<REACTION>The other kind of tasks are known as <color:#1>bounty hunts</color>. You can sign up for these in Swift Solutions.
Bounty hunts involve the elimination of designated monsters—typically of a rather fearsome persuasion.
If you ever want to check the details of the tasks you have agreed to undertake, consult your <color:#1>Journal</color>, accessible from the Main Menu.
I think that should be enough for you to be getting on with for now. Good luck in taking on those tasks!
Ah, so you wish to find out a bit more about stamp cards, do you? Well, you've certainly come to the right place!
When you complete a task, you will receive stamps on what is known as a <color:#1>merit stamp card</color>.
As your stamp cards fill up, you can exchange them for <color:#1>merit awards</color>.
These awards are bound to come in handy on your travels.
<NL>To exchange completed merit stamp cards for merit awards, simply visit the nearest branch of <color:#1>Swift Solutions</color>.
Happy collecting!
I see you wish to learn more about navigating at sea.<NL>Well, I shall endeavor to teach you all you need to know.
You can steer your ship with [stk_l], while [stk_r] adjusts the viewpoint. Of course, this is nothing you are not already familiar with.
To disembark, <color:#1>approach the shore</color> and press [btn_ok].
When you wish to get back on board, <color:#1>approach your ship</color> and press [btn_ok].
It is all too easy to lose one's bearings at sea, so be sure to make use of the <color:#1>world map</color> to keep track of your location.
When you are at sea, press [btn_r1] to consult this map. Otherwise, press [btn_r1] to open the local map, and then press [btn_tri] to view the world map.
I wish you well as you take to the high seas!
Allow me to teach you more about the ancient art of dragon-riding.
Your dragon, <color:#1>Tengri</color>, can be directed with [stk_l], while [stk_r] adjusts your viewpoint.
When you wish to land, press [btn_ok] and a <color:#1>circle</color> will appear beneath you.
Use [stk_l] to move the circle, and press [btn_ok] once you've found a safe spot to land. If you wish to keep flying, press [btn_can] and the circle will vanish.
A <color:#1>blue circle</color> means you can press [btn_ok] to descend, while a <color:#1>red circle</color> means the area is unsuitable for landing.
When you are on the ground and wish to call Tengri, use the <color:#1>dragon horn</color>, or press [key_u].
I wish you luck as you take to the skies!
Now, there are certain things you should know when getting behind the wheel of your new automobile.
Painstakingly put together by your best friend Phil, the <color:#1>Philmobile 2000's</color> bright yellow bodywork really makes it stand out from the crowd.
Use [stk_lud] to drive forward and reverse, and [stk_llr] to turn. Ah, and be sure to wear your seatbelt!
It takes a little getting used to, but you'll be sure to love whizzing around in the Philmobile. You can even bash into monsters without having to do battle with them!
When you want to hop out of your car, press [btn_ok].
And when you feel the need for speed and wish to get back in, use the <color:#1>Philmobile key</color> or simply press [key_d].
That's all from me! Drive carefully, won't you?

Grrrrr!
Have you seen Philip, dear?<NL>He must still be out there somewhere.
Run on home now, Oliver.<NL>Your mother will be waiting for you.
I heard from my boy that Philip has been secretly working away at something.
I know it's good for you youngsters to have your hobbies, but don't go causing trouble now, you hear?
Hey, Ollie! I know you and Phil are up to something!<NL>Why don't you let me in on it?
Why, good morning, Oliver!<NL>How's your mother?
You mean a Coupe D-Lux, dear?<NL>Why, that's the auto everybody's talking about!
Ooh, I'm so jealous!
What's the matter, son?<NL>Never seen a gasoline stand before?
Oh, gee... I'm sure I'm forgetting something...<NL>But I can't think what it might be...<NL>Oh, shoot... And just look at the time!
The adults here in Motorville are all fine, upstanding citizens. If you listen to your mother, you'll grow into a fine, upstanding citizen, too!
Phew! My first vacation in months! And I'm going to make the best of it by doing absolutely nothing! Nada! Zip! Diddly-squat!
Do you like what they've done with the town square?<NL>I take the wife and kids there a lot. It's nice to have such a wide open space right in the center of town.
I can't wait for supper time!<NL>I've bought myself a delicious TV dinner, you see...
Oh, my! But I forgot to buy some milk from Miss Leila's store! What's dinner without a nice big glass of milk, huh?
My, these potatoes are so cheap! Perhaps I'll make some nice, healthy french fries for the kids...
How do you like my hot rod?<NL>She's a real beauty, ain't she?<NL>And brand new, too!
Maybe one day you'll be able to afford your own car and be as cool as me, kid!
When does the diner open? I've got some serious gossip to overhear!
Why if it isn't young Oliver! You be sure to look both ways when you're crossing the road now, won't you?
Sorry to bother you so early in the morning. I guess we'll just have to bite the bullet and buy a new one soon, huh?
I guess you might. But if you have any more problems with it in the meantime, just let me know. I'll be there in a jiffy!
Hello, young Oliver!<NL>Be careful on the road, won't you?
Do you know how an engine works, kiddo? Heh, of course you don't. But you will one day. Comes with living in this town!
It's an important job servicing people's autos, you know. Why, one loose bolt could cause a terrible accident!
Good morning, Oliver!
Oh, my! Just look at all the leaves and branches all over the ground here! What an awful mess!
Jeepers... What in jinkers is this?
The weather is just swell! I might go sit in the town square and enjoy it for a while...
My husband just bought a new auto. It's called, uh...a Coupy Lux or something screwy like that...

Go and talk to Phil!
Mom's waiting for her groceries. Time to head home!

pla-a_020_010-t01_npc_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Don't let anybody see you, okay?
Grrr!
Off to play with young Philip, are you, son?<NL>Don't worry—I won't tattle on you.
But it's already late. You be sure to get home before your mother starts to worry, won't you?
Why, good evening, Oliver!<NL>What are you doing out so late?
Ahh, there's nothing quite like a hot meal after a hard day's work! This is the life!
Gee, is that the time? I have to get on home and see what my wife has cooked for dinner!
The adults here in Motorville are all fine, upstanding citizens. If you listen to your mother, you'll grow into a fine, upstanding citizen, too!
...Wait—did I tell you that already today?
All I need is a good night's sleep, and I'll be set for a hard day's relaxing tomorrow...
Boy, that TV dinner was something else! I'm gonna try me another one tomorrow—the only question is which one...
What are you doing, kid?<NL>It's late—there's nobody around!
But this is Motorville...<NL>I guess you'll be okay.
Oh, hi...<NL>Um, did you want something?
Mom's fast asleep...

Head over to Phil's garage!
Time for a test-drive! Check if the coast is clear!

pla-a_030_010-t01_npc_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Grrrrrr!
I hope you're feeling a little better now, Oliver.
Don't do anything dangerous like that again now, will you? You have to take care, son. It's what your mother would have wanted.
Oh my, it'll be dark soon.<NL>I should be making a start on supper...
Shoot, now I've done it! I should never have closed it while the engine was still running...
The adults here in Motorville are all fine, upstanding citizens. Which means you'll grow into a fine, upstanding citizen, too!
Your mother can be sure of that.<NL>Wherever she is now...
My shift finished up a little early today. I'm going to take the opportunity to go on home and play with my kids. It's sure been a while...
Urrrgh... I think my eyes must be a little bigger than my belly... I ate way too much for dinner...
Jeepers, I hope the old girl starts...
What am I saying? I fixed her—she's sure to run like a dream...
What do you think, Oliver, dear? It looks a whole lot better now I've cleaned up all those leaves and branches, hm?
Why, there isn't so much as a twig left!<NL>It's spotless!
Uh, yes, Ma'am.<NL>Thank you for doing that.
Oh, there's no need to thank me, dear.<NL>It's my pleasure.
I cleaned up every last leaf and branch.<NL>Why, there isn't so much as a twig in sight!
A nice, long walk will help with the diet... Oh no, not mine, silly! I'm talking about Rover here!
Eh? What are you looking at? Don't tell me youer thinking of using this lamppost as a flipping wand!
Well, you can cut that out, for a start.<NL>It's way too flipping big!
We need a <color:#1>stick</color> or something like that, en't it?<NL>Why don't we go and have a look over by there?
O-Okay...
This is one proper tidy motor, eh?<NL>Might get meself one of these...
...Ahem! Sorry, now's not really the time, is it.
There en't anything wandlike over by here either.<NL>Let's go and look over the other side, shall we?
Uh... Okay...
Oh, and when you find something, don't forget to pop it in youer bag for safekeeping.
Put it in my <color:#1>bag</color>...<NL>Sure.
Oi, where d'you think youer going!?<NL>You got a <color:#1>fireplace</color> outside or something?

Grrrrrr!
The town square is the best place for miles around to see the night sky. The bench by the fountain is my special stargazing spot!
Why, good evening, Oliver!<NL>What are you doing out so late?
Thank goodness—my friend brought me my spare latchkey. Now I can finally go home to bed!
It sure does, Son. Hmm, maybe it's a little too late to drive all the way home... I guess we'd better see if there's a motel around here, huh?
You're as scatterbrained as ever, I see...
Urrrgh... I think my eyes must be a little bigger than my belly... I ate way too much for dinner...
Well, if it isn't young Oliver! What are you doing, dear? It's dark already! Run along home now!
Phew! That was a long day! I can't wait to get home and have me a nice, relaxing bath!
Hello, young Oliver!<NL>Are you headed for the town square?
It's been so great seeing how the city folk live, Pop, but it's gotten kinda late. Time sure does fly when you're having fun!
I just love to take a walk after dark.<NL>Are you out walking, too?
Gee, it's gotten kinda dark.<NL>I think I'll run on home soon...

First spells, now familiars... Youer turning into a proper wizard, en't it, Ollie-boy!?
I guess I am, huh!
Now then, why don't you take a closer look at youer new mate, eh?
Uh... How do I do that, Mr. Drippy?
It's a piece of cake, mun! Now, listen up!
Now, youer still new to this wizarding lark, so there's a limit to what you can do, en't it?
But keep fighting monsters and eventually you'll get stronger. We call that <color:#1>leveling up</color>, see!
You'll probably make some new mates before long, and all—so be sure to take a closer look at them, like I showed you.
You got it, Mr. Drippy!
Crikey! I knew there was something I'd forgot to tell you about familiars!
Huh? What's that?
This is important, Ollie-boy, so listen carefully, all right?
I showed you how youer familiars can use <color:#1>tricks</color>, didn't I?
Well, as the little fellows get stronger, they'll start learning new ones!
Anyway, the important thing is that you assign a trick to youer familiar's command wheel. If you don't, you won't be able to use it. Simple as that.
Okay, I think I got it!
Be sure to let me know how your journey progresses, young man.

En't it beautiful, Ollie-boy!?<NL>Ah, it's good to be back...
Oh yeah! Here. It's just a little something. Consider it a gift from the Lord High Lord of the Fairies!
Uh...thanks. But what do I do with these?
Just have a munch on one when youer feeling a bit ropey, and you'll be right as rain in no time, mun!
But a wizard cannot live by bread alone, Ollie-boy! He needs a proper wand an all—and that knobbly thing in youer hand is doing my flipping head in!
See that big castle to the north?<NL>That's <color:#1>Ding Dong Dell</color>, that is.
I reckon we'll find ouerselves a wand by there.<NL>So, let's get moving, shall we!
Okay!
Oh knickers! There's something I forgot to tell you...
Wh-What's that, Mr. Drippy?
You can switch <color:#8>vibration</color> on and off there as well, en't it?
Speaking personally, I'd have it on. A rumble just en't a rumble without a bit of rumble, is it?
Now, I know this is a lot to take in, Ollie-boy, but I'm sure you'll get used to it!
I-I guess!

Oh, Oliver... Seeing you, I...<NL>I just don't know what to say, dear...
It's fine, Miss Leila.<NL>...I'm okay now!
You are? Well I'm pleased to hear that, honey...but if there's anything I can do, just let me know, won't you?
Actually, there's something you can do for me right now, Miss Leila—you can tell me where Timmy is. Is he here in the store?
Well, now that you mention it, I don't think I've seen him... Timmy! ...Timmy! Where's my Timmy Toldrum?
He must have run off somewhere, the little rascal...
He's probably gone exploring, huh...
Oi, Ollie-boy! Does this little situation remind you of anything?
It sure does! It's just like what happened with King Tom!
Bingo! We've got ouerselves a missing cat king in one world, and a missing fat cat in another! And I reckon the reason why'll be the same, too!
Track down Timmy, and youer sure to find...
...the vital clue that will help solve the mystery!
There's sharp of you! And this here's youer patch, en't it? You know it like the back of youer hand!
Uh-huh! I'll solve the Case of the Missing Cat in no time!
I'm awfully sorry I couldn't help you, dearie...
But you did help!<NL>Thanks, Miss Leila!
I...I did...? Well, all right, then.<NL>Good-bye now, dear!
G'bye, Miss Leila!
Righto, Ollie-boy. Let's start out where you know best, shall we? Round by youer house, I mean.
Sure! Let's go!
Huh? That girl...!
Miss Leila!<NL>It's Timmy, he's...!
Oh, goodness! My Timmy Toldrum!<NL>Whatever happened to you?
Oliver! Let me show you where Mr. Kitty is!
Oliver! You have to go in there!
I reckon that door might open with a bit of magic, Ollie-boy. You know the spell I mean, don't you? Unlocks doors and that, en't it.
...Huh?<NL>...It won't open.
Eh? That's proper weird... A rubbish little lock like that should've popped undone easy-peasy...
Hm? Hnnnnnnggghhhmmm!?
What's wrong, Mr. Drippy?
It's this door, mun! There's an evil power protecting it! Youer spell didn't fail—it was repelled by a malevolent force!
Wh— Repelled?<NL>Jeepers...
Must be the girl, en't it? She's the soul mate of a sage's daughter, after all...
You think?<NL>So what do we do?
I'll tell you what we don't do—carry on trying to get in by the front door. It's not exactly polite just barging into people's houses, anyway.
You're right.<NL>I guess we'll have to find some other way...
What are you doing, mun? We already know that won't work, en't it? We've got to find another way of getting in.
This here must be Rusty's garage.
I got a bad feeling in my lantern about this. You'd best make sure youer good and ready before you go in.
O-Okay, Mr. Drippy.
Um, excuse me, Ma'am.
Oh, why you're...<NL>You're Allie's son...
Uh, yes... That's right.<NL>I... I have something to ask you.
Mrs. Cartwright...could I borrow a little of your <color:#1>kindness</color>?
Hm? I'm sorry, dear, I don't think I quite—
I need it to make Mr. Cartwright better!<NL>Please, I need it so that I can help him!
I really don't have the first idea what you're talking about...
But if it stands even the smallest chance of helping my husband...then sure, I'll do it.
Thank you so much, Mrs. Cartwright!
It's <color:#1>kindness</color> we need, Ollie-boy!<NL>And it's this lady by here that's got it!
...Wh-What did you do?<NL>I feel almost...warm inside.
Tidy! That means it worked, en't it!<NL>Now give it to Rusty, there's a good lad!
Okay!
Betty...just...<NL>Just leave me alone, will you!
Come on, mun, hurry up! Hand over the <color:#1>kindness</color> before we have another flipping Nightmare on ouer hands!
O-Okay!
Nnngh... What are you...doing?
Don't just stand there, Ollie-boy! Give matey by here the <color:#1>kindness</color> you got off his wife, en't it!
Huh? The door is closed...
Aooo!
Righto, Ollie-boy!<NL>Time to hand over that <color:#1>confidence</color>!
Phil!
...Oh, it's you.<NL>Come to get even, huh?
"Even"?<NL>Even for what?
...All I wanted was to build an auto all of my own.
A hot rod faster and finer than any other...
Sure you did, Phil!<NL>It was what we both wanted!
But my dream, it...
It killed somebody...
Gee, uh...
It... It killed your mom...!
Don't say that, Phil! Don't ever say that!<NL>It wasn't your fault!
I don't want to worry you, Ollie-boy, but there's a funny look in youer mate's eyes...
How can you say we should follow our dreams...<NL>It's thanks to my crummy dreams that your mom...
Ollie-boy! Give him that <color:#1>ambition</color> you got off youerself before he drives me potty, will you?
Yes! I'll fix him with a piece of my own heart!
Huh...?<NL>What did you...? What is this...?
I feel kinda...warm inside...
It feels...warm...
Hey, this is...<NL>It's Mom's diary.
Look! The pendant she gave me!<NL>It's glowing!
In my dream, Pea told me something.<NL>She said "the ash is falling again."
She must know something!<NL>We need to find her!
Fair enough. Well, if you've got any ideas, let's go and ferret her out, shall we?
Are you sure you should be out and about so soon, Oliver, dear? Look after yourself, won't you, honey?
Wherever could my Timmy Toldrum be?<NL>He just won't stop running off lately...
Thank you so much, Oliver, dear! My Timmy must have been awfully heavy—I hope you didn't hurt yourself!
Well, if it isn't young Oliver! You sure do seem to be having an awful lot of fun lately, dearie!
Oh my, I just can't stop eating!<NL>(sigh) Which means I can't stop running, either...
There's nothing finer than a cool glass of milk and a big plate of delicious cheese after a little exercise!
Oliver honey, have you seen Philip lately?
He hasn't come to see me here at the store in a while now. You're his best friend, dearie. Do you think you could check on him for me?
Goodness, Oliver, you've grown so big and strong lately! I hardly recognize you, dear!
I, I have...?
Oh ho ho! Well some things haven't changed, I see—you still get all mixed up when somebody pays you a compliment!
I haven't seen that adorable little girl in the white dress lately. Do you think she could have left town without saying good-bye?
I have the strangest feeling I've been exercising in my dreams lately.
I may be being a silly old fool, but I wake up just drenched in sweat! Do you think I can count that as part of my training regime?
Oliver dear, I think it's time I told you something. It's about your mother...
It was right before you were born... I found her collapsed by the side of the road right here in town.
She was wearing such strange clothes... And all she would tell me was that she had come from somewhere far, far away...
I don't know what happened for her to wind up all alone like that, but...
...when you were born, she was so happy. Really, truly happy. You could see it in her eyes.
And she would always say...
"I've finally met the most important person of all."
And I just knew she was talking about you, honey. She loved you more than anything else in the whole, wide world...
That important person Allie used to talk about... I just know it was you, dearie.
Just you wait and see—I'm gonna make the fastest car in the whole, wide world! Faster than this two-bit town has ever seen!
I just know you will, Phil!<NL>If anybody can do it, it's you!
Hey, Ollie. Where you been lately? You're like the Incredible Disappearing Man these days.
H-Huh!? Me, uhh... D-Disappearing...?<NL>Well, I, uh...
What kind of a pal are you, huh? If you've found somewhere super-neat to go play, why dontcha let me in on it, huh?
Say, Ollie. Remember how the hot rod we built sank to the bottom of the river?
I was thinking maybe we could try and drag it out somehow. But then...with the money that would cost, we could buy some real neat parts...
And I guess it comes with some bad memories, too... Maybe not, huh...
Hey, guess what, Ollie—I'm building a new one! An all-new racing machine!
It'll make that hunka junk we built before look like a kid's toy! And it'll be sleeker and faster than a jet fighter!
...At least, I hope it will.
Heh. Sure it will, Phil.
You bet your keister it will!<NL>There's no stopping me this time!
And when it's finished, you'll be the first to drive it! Put it in your diary, kiddo—we're gonna make history!
I've redesigned the old race car we built from scratch. The Philmobile 2000 is gonna be the coolest thing on four wheels!
I bet you can't wait to see it, huh?
Ngh...
This feeling... This warmth...<NL>I'd forgotten what it was like...
Myrtle's sickness was all my fault. But things will be different now. We're going to be a family again.
That's a swell cape you've got there, son.<NL>Suits you down to the ground!
Myrtle is better now, and it's all thanks to you.<NL>They won't be calling her Starey Mary anymore!
I can't seem to focus on fixing autos right now. All I can think about is a nice, ripe banana with vanilla ice cream... Mmm... Deee-licious!
...Ahem. What am I doing telling a kid like you that? Forget I said anything, will you?
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Philip lately...
He used to come by here and spy on me working all the time. Heh. And so did you...
How are you doing, son? Heh, I guess I won't be able to call you that much longer—seems like you've done an awful lot of growing up lately.
You must be about old enough to start dating, huh? How about my Myrtle? Ho ho ho! That was a joke, son. A joke.
I've been fixing autos for years, but new garages and factories are springing up all over town lately.
I'm sure glad the auto trade has been kind to our town, but I can't help worrying about what it means for smaller businesses like mine...
I guess the way an engine works must seem like magic to regular folks, huh.
And in a way, it is. People always dreamed of being able to travel as far and as fast as they wanted, and now they can.
Are you sure that's all you need to make my husband better?
Thank goodness...<NL>My husband is back at long last...
My husband, and now my daughter, too...<NL>It's... It's like a dream come true...
This is all thanks to you, isn't it?
Why, hello, Oliver!<NL>Have you been to Miss Leila's store?
If you haven't, you're in for a surprise!<NL>Hee hee!
I don't know what's going on with Denny from next door. He and Myrtle were great friends, but lately, he's just been staying indoors...
Do you think it's the same thing that happened to Myrtle? Is there anything I can do to help?
I saw Denny go running out of his house like a little rocket! I'm so glad he's better!
Wait... Did you have something to do with that, too?
Poor Philip. Ever since the accident, he just hasn't been the same.
You're still friends, aren't you? Gosh, it must be difficult... But it's at times like these that friends need each other most, dear.
It's adorable—Myrtle's made a little friend.<NL>A dear, sweet thing in a white dress.
I wonder where she lives... I thought I knew every family in town...
I don't see that little girl in the white dress anymore. She used to come play in our garden all the time...
I sure hope she's okay. There are so many cars in town these days. It's dangerous...
Hmm... I'd like Myrtle to start dressing with a little more style...
You know, girls these days are even wearing skirts as high as their knees! I wouldn't want her to dress like that, of course...
Thank you so much, Oliver.<NL>I feel like I could do anything now!
Miss Leila always does this after she goes running.
But if she eats that much cheese, there's no point in her running at all! Well, she'd say that was the point, I guess...
I'm really starting to enjoy working in the store.<NL>You'll buy something while you're here, won't you?
We have to go to Denny's house right away!
We have to find Denny!
Please, Oliver—you have to help Denny!
Hee hee! I'm so glad Denny's back to his old energetic self!
Thank you so much for helping him, Oliver!<NL>You saved the day all over again!
You know, watching you almost makes me believe in magic...
Oliver, I...I made a mistake at work...
I ordered too much cheese.<NL>And I was just so upset with myself...
But it doesn't do to stay upset for too long. And besides, Miss Leila seemed kinda happy about it...
You're friends with Philip, aren't you, Oliver? I always used to see you together out of my window.
I was kinda jealous of you both...<NL>But now I have lots of friends—you included!
Something's different about you, Oliver.<NL>You seem more grown-up somehow...<NL>Taller, maybe...? More...
...Oh! Uh, forget it. I'd better be getting back to work.
Oliver! Miss Leila thinks because she dreamed about exercising, that means she can eat more cheese!
Don't you think that's just screwy!?
Hello, Oliver!<NL>Would you like to buy something?
Or did you come to see me?
Huh!?<NL>N-No! Uh, I mean...
I was joking, silly!<NL>Hee hee!
Nnngh...<NL>I can't run anymore...
Oi, Ollie-boy! This boy needs a <color:#1>confidence</color> injection, and fast!
Huh...? What...? What are you doing...?
Hey there, Oliver!<NL>My leg's all better now!
I always try to race the cars, but they're too fast for me.
But one day, I'll overtake them!<NL>I won't stop training until I do!
Hey, Oliver...<NL>I, uh... I dreamed about you the other night...
You were real down, just like I was that time, and you couldn't do anything.
But it looks like you're okay!<NL>It was just a dumb dream after all!
I often see Miss Leila when I'm running through the town square. Sometimes we even go running together.
But eating cheeseburgers while you're running pretty much defeats the point...
When I'm running my fastest, I sometimes feel like I could lift right off the ground and start flying.
Imagine, just soaring through the sky, with the whole world stretched out beneath you... That would be so, so neat!
Grrr! Woof!
Grrreat to see you!<NL>How are you?
Grrr! You have to help my master!
Aooo! Aoooooo!
Arf! Woof!<NL>Grrr!
Grrr! Who are you?<NL>What business do you have with my master?
Woof! Grrr!
My master is the greatest!<NL>Grrrahahaharrr!
Aooo!<NL>Aoooooo!
I don't trust those cars. How do they move so fast? Grrr... They're cheating, I know it...
Grrr... Arf!
Grrr! My master has been worried about you!<NL>Don't do anything stupid, will you?
Grrrrrr!<NL>Aoooooo!
That Leila lady has always been a strange one!<NL>Grrrahahahaharrr!
Aooo!<NL>Ao-aooo!
I dream about flying, too...<NL>Hey! Are you laughing at me!? Grrr!
Meoooooowww!
Hmmmeowww!?
Hmmmyuh!?<NL>You can understand one?
One must apologize for the inconvenience one caused you the other day. Thank you for carrying one back to Miss Leila.
Huh? Oh... Oh, that's fine.<NL>It was our pleasure.
One is in your debt, and eternally at your service.
Gee... So that's how Timmy talks, huh?
Who knew old Catface was such a posho, eh?
Mmmyarf!
One's owner has no sooner exercised and eaten than she is fast asleep. Much like oneself, in fact...
Mmmyoink!
One has been accompanying one's owner on her runs of late. If one is honest, one's body is quite falling to pieces...
Mmmyadayada!
Young Philip's pranks have always been somewhat irritating, but one is almost missing him in his absence. Almost...
Mmmyummm!
Hmmm... One can tell from your face that you have triumphed over great adversity. You look positively radiant!
Mmmyello!
One has not seen the young glowing girl recently.
One was not entirely fond of being referred to as "Mr. Kitty," but she was an endearing little thing...
Mmmyibbit!
One had a dream that one had become a most fearsome monster!
And one was locked in mortal combat with a young man who was quite the spitting image of yourself! Thank goodness it was merely a dream...
Mmmyoo-oo-ooo!
Your dear mother was always so kind to one.
She always knew just what one wished to eat.<NL>Yes, a quite remarkable woman...
Howdy, Oliver! I'm taking the family to see a double-feature at the new drive-in this weekend. Let me know if you'd like to join us!
Gee willikers! Who parks like that? Whoever it is oughta be ashamed of themselves!
Hey, Ollie! If you're looking for Phil, I haven't seen him yet this morning.
Hey, Ollie! How come you're wearing that goofy outfit?<NL>Is somebody having a costume party?
Hey, Ollie, how come Phil's acting like such a square lately?
All he does is study those crummy car books all day. They oughta put him in the nuthouse!
Good day to you, Oliver!<NL>You're looking as perky as ever!
Whatever are those strange clothes you're wearing, Oliver? Are you playing at superheroes?
My, you do look well, Oliver!<NL>You'll be all grown-up soon!
My, wouldn't it be nice to have an auto... I'd just love to go visit some of the neighboring towns, but I just don't feel inclined to walk.
Young Myrtle down at Leila's store is such a lovely girl. Always with a smile for everybody, and so polite!
If only she would take just a little more care of her appearance. There's no excuse for not following fashion in this day and age.
Oh, gee... My car keys... Car keys...<NL>Gosh, I've gone and lost my car keys!<NL>Oh, gee... And just look at the time!
What a fine outfit you have on, young Oliver! Why, I once had one just like it myself!
A man can't do without a toolbox, son. Why, just the other day, I lost my car keys, so I pulled out my tools and—hey presto!—I was in!
The adults here in Motorville are all fine, upstanding citizens. Which means you'll grow into a fine, upstanding citizen, too!
You look quite the wizard in that outfit, young man.<NL>And how about that cape? Can you fly, hm?<NL>Would you show me?
What is that strange book you carry around everywhere, Oliver?
Come to think of it, I used to see your mother with one just like it. Is it a journal or some such?
Welcome to Motorville, the cleanest, nicest, friendliest little town in all the— Oh, Oliver, it's you. How you keeping, son?
The auto industry may be big here in Motorville, but it's still a sleepy little one-horse town at heart.
And that means we'd rather take our time and do a mighty fine job than rush things just to make a quick buck.
They just opened a new diner down there by the town square. Seems like a real nice place.
I always see you appearing from over by the town square there. Do you have friends on the other side or something, son?
Diners mean food, and food means drink, and drink means...more food!
Well now, isn't that a swell outfit you've got on there.<NL>You look every inch the superhero!
I love nothing more than a few minutes alone with a book in the town square after a hamburger or three over at the diner.
And if I happen to fall asleep there in the shade, all the better. Nothing in life is more important than a little rest and relaxation.
You must drink plenty of full-cream milk and eat lots of red meat if you want to grow up big and strong!<NL>That's why Leila's store is such a great help!
Leila has even started selling cheese lately. She's got everything a woman needs to feed a growing family!
(sigh) My hot rod's mill sounds a little off lately. And I only just bought her, too...
I sure hope I didn't blow a gasket drag racing down on the strip...
I love my hot rod, but I spend my whole time sweating about wrapping the darned thing around a tree.
Man, why do I have to be such a wet rag...?
When I'm on my break, I like to come out here and read— Oh, shoot! I forgot my book again!
I bet you can't guess which of these autos is mine, huh? It's that souped-up little beauty over there! That's right—the hot pink number!
Wh-What do you mean it doesn't suit me?<NL>We go together like meat and jello!
Hey there, Oliver. I'm just on my way to pick up my auto from the shop. She's just been in for a tune-up.
Which garage do I use? Oh, the one just down the street from here. I wouldn't go anywhere else!
I see Rusty and Betty Cartwright out taking the air together all the time lately. Boy, do they ever look happy together...
I sure wish I had me a wife like that...
The girl in the house next door never leaves home, but I see her in the window sometimes. She's a real cutie.
Sorry to bother you again and again...<NL>Hopefully it'll stay fixed this time.
Thank you so, so much! You're a saint!
If you ever get into any trouble again, let me know.<NL>I'll be there in a jiffy!
It's broken again? Then I guess we'll just have to fix it again, huh? Always happy to help, Ma'am!
Hey, kid! You shouldn't be hanging around here. My boss will chew me out good if something happens. Go on, beat it!
Hello, young Oliver! I hope you're studying hard!<NL>No cutting class, you hear?
I hear from Philip you've been playing hooky an awful lot lately, Oliver.
I know you've had it hard, but you have to stay in school, son. You don't want to wind up a railroad bum, do you?
I heard some kids from the town built a car, but they got into some kind of accident. It's terrible news and all, but you gotta admire their spirit.
This town was built on the auto business, and most of the kids here dream of making cars when they grow up.
Which is why we have to be sure to pass on everything we know to the next generation of Motorvilleans.
What are you looking at, kid?<NL>Haven't you seen a gasoline stand before?
What do you mean twenty cents a gallon is expensive?
What are they thinking, hiding a gasoline stand back here?
Nobody's ever going to find it!
Hello, Oliver! You look as full of beans as ever, dear!
Whatever are you wearing, dear?<NL>Is this some kind of fad with you young folks?
There's been no trash dropped here lately, and no leaves have blown here either. It sure makes keeping the place clean a little easier.
But I can't help feeling a little...aimless.
Whoa, a gas-o-line stand!?<NL>No way...!
Yeah? Then how come you and me are standing here talking about it?
Momma says if she had her one of those automatic washing machines, she'd hang another load on the line just to make the most of this fine weather!
Uh, say...d'you wanna maybe, um...go to the drive-in with me sometime?
Bow wow!<NL>Bow wow wow!
What's wrong, boy? He's barking at something behind you. Don't tell me it's a ghost or a Martian or something screwy like that!
He's barking again! Hee hee!<NL>I think he likes you!
The kitty-cat in Leila's store always seems to be chasing something.
Either he's cracked, or that place has mice!
Why's everybody flipping their lids about autos?<NL>I'm more of a cycle girl myself...

Uh... Excuse me, Sir?<NL>I wonder if you could do us a favor...
I wish I could, I really do...but I'm afraid I can't open this gate without my colleague's permission!
Oh no, it's not that...<NL>We just want to borrow some of your <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>!
Ha ha! Well, if it's <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> you're after, I've got plenty to spare! Take as much as you want!
Thank you, Sir!
Uh... Mr. Drippy? How do I get the <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> out of his, uh, heart...?
Look at the pages Old Treeface gave you for youer book, en't it!? It's the spell called <color:#8>Take Heart</color> you need to cast first.
<color:#8>Take Heart</color>, huh?<NL>Sure!
It's <color:#8>Take Heart</color> you need to cast, Ollie-boy! It's on one of them pages Old Barkface gave you, en't it!?
Hnnngh! Hup hup!<NL>One! Two! One! Two!
Hm? You want to enter the town, do you?<NL>Well, I'm afraid that's impossible at the moment. It's my colleague, you see...
He's the one in charge of letting people in, but recently he's just been refusing to do it. He says he can't be bothered...
So we need to give this guard the <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> we got from his friend, huh?
That's right, Ollie-boy.<NL>The spell you'll need this time is <color:#8>Give Heart</color>, en't it?
I know it sounds just like the other one, but don't get them mixed up, whatever you do!
Don't worry, Mr. Drippy! <color:#8>Give Heart</color> is the one for repairing broken hearts. I'll remember that!
Now, when you cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color>, you'll need to choose the piece of heart you want to restore from youer <color:#1>Locket</color>.
'Course, you've only got one in there at the moment, so even you can't mess this up! Go on then, give that guard his <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> back!
All right, here goes!
<color:#8>Give Heart</color>, Ollie-boy! That's the spell you need! Take that <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> out of youer Locket, and give it to the guard!
(sigh)...
This is a disgrace! I've been here for hours!<NL>When are they going to start letting people in!?
I wonder why they're not letting anyone in...
It doesn't look like any of us are going anywhere in the near future...
What's going on here!?<NL>They can't keep us all waiting like this!
Mama... I need pee-pee...
Oh dear... I do hope they let us in soon.<NL>I need to buy the ingredients for my husband's favorite dinner!
I swear that girl over there keeps looking at me.<NL>I hope they keep us out here a little longer...
They've got to let us in!<NL>Mother will go spare if I'm late again...!

Here we go, Ollie-boy!<NL>Now ouer adventure can really begin!
You've even got youerself a proper wand and everything! I bet youer excited, eh?
I sure am!
Right then, Ollie-boy. I reckon there's some proper nasty monsters round by here.
Don't try to be a hard man and take them all on.<NL>Just hurry up and get to Al Mamoon, en't it!
This is the first time I've been out of Al Mamoon in ages, Oliver!
Ha ha! And you sure do look happy about it!
Esther... The purpose of this journey is to take the Trials...<NL>
Youer not wrong, mun! This en't a flipping day trip, you know! Get moving!
All right, all right! Lead the way!
That's the spirit! Now then, let's—
Hang on a minute... Did that sand by there just move? It flipping did, mun! It's a monster, en't it!?
Right then, Ollie-boy. Since youer going to be fighting with Esther from now on, I'd better teach you some new moves, en't it?
Ready, you two?
Yes!
Fine work, Oliver.<NL>Your magical abilities are indeed impressive.
As is your rapport with your familiar, daughter.
Hee hee! I do my best!
You know, Oliver, I'd love to try fighting with your familiar sometime.
Huh!? You can do that?
Do that, and we can swap familiars!
Gee, that's pretty neat!<NL>I had no idea...
Hee hee! Yes, you can control my drongo as well, if you like, Oliver!
In fact, everybody has a <color:#1>type of familiar that they get on especially well with</color>.
Use the type of familiar that's right for you, and their performance will be that much better!
You can check what types of familiars you get along well with by selecting <color:#1>Friends &amp; Familiars</color> from the Main Menu.
Right, enough chitchat, you two!<NL>We need to get to that Temple of Trials, en't it!?
Indeed. It is located in the <color:#1>northeast of the Shimmering Sands</color>. I suggest we head there immediately.
All right!
The Temple of Trials lies on the other side of this gorge. Perhaps this is a good place for a moment's respite.<NL>
Flipping heck, mun, am I glad you suggested that!<NL>I'm a forest fairy, me. My fairy suit en't even sandproof!
We're stopping already?<NL>But I could go on for ages yet!
Really? ...Aren't you even a little tired?<NL>It's so hot...
Hm. You will endure far worse things at the Temple of Trials, Oliver.
Gee... So the Trials are pretty tough, huh?
Indeed. That is why you must get some rest.<NL>I will keep watch. You will sleep.
And stay close to the fire.<NL>The desert grows cold at night.
All right, Mr. Rashaad, Sir!
Good morning, Oliver!<NL>Did you sleep well?
Uh... Not really.<NL>I guess I'm a little worried about the Trials...
Oh dear... Well I hope you won't doze off in the middle of them!
...Though I have to say, I didn't sleep very well myself.<NL>I kept thinking about that girl—my other self...
It's so strange. She's not like me at all, but it doesn't feel like she's a different person...
Well, soul mates are funny like that, en't it?<NL>Different—but the same. There's profound!<NL>Anyway, are we taking the Trials or what!?
Oliver, Esther...<NL>The Temple of Trials lies north of here.
The tests that await you there are unforgiving, but I have faith in you.
Thank you, Sir!
Let's go, Oliver!<NL>I want to show you how brave I am—just like Myrtle did!
What's that rumbling noise, Ollie-boy?<NL>It en't youer stomach, is it?
Uh...
Oh my goodness!<NL>Look over there!
Crikey! Look at this monument by here!
Well, this didn't make it here by accident.<NL>It must have something to do with the stones!
Hey, look. There's something written on it...
[nz_t][nz_a][nz_sp1][nz_t][nz_e][nz_r][nz_c][nz_e][nz_s][nz_e][nz_sp1]<NL>[nz_s][nz_t][nz_r][nz_a][nz_p][nz_m][nz_i][nz_p][nz_a][nz_m][nz_e][nz_sp1]<page><NL>[nz_t][nz_v][nz_o][nz_sp1][nz_i][nz_v][nz_v][nz_t][nz_o][nz_n][nz_s][nz_e][nz_i][nz_l]<NL>[nz_t][nz_r][nz_a][nz_e][nz_h][nz_s][nz_t][nz_i][nz_n][nz_i][nz_t][nz_v][nz_b]
What's this funny writing?
Nazcaän, en't it!? And it probably tells us where them stones are hidden, and all! Shall I decode it for you,<NL>Ollie-boy?
Yes, please, Mr. Drippy!
Righto! Gis a sec... Ahem! It says...<NL>"The secret that the map imparts,<NL>Lies not without but in its heart."
...And that means what, exactly?
It means, if I'm not very much mistaken...that the stones en't on this island.
What!?
You heard me! The secret of where they're hidden "lies not without," it said—meaning not on the surface of the map, for all to see.
And I reckon that bit about it being "in its heart" means the <color:#1>real locations of the stones</color> are lurking somewhere <color:#1>inside</color> the flipping thing.
So, uh...how do we, um...get them out?
Well, I don't flipping know, do I!?
Calm down, Drippy!<NL>It's not as if we even have the map at the moment...
Looks like we'd better go and talk to old Kublai again.<NL>Giddy up, Tengri!
This would appear to be a dead end...<NL>But I am quite certain that there was once a<NL>passage through here... Curious.
A path has opened along the cliffside!<NL>...And yet I fear I lack the courage to follow it.<NL>Ghouls lie in wait, I am almost certain...

I'm just in the middle of my annual stock-take, dear—a hooge task at the best of times. But I should be open for business again tomorrow. Toodle-hoo!
Cawmiserations, friend, but I'm not allowed to sell weapons or armor to travelers. You're going to need special permission from the King...
Welcome to Swift Solutions, where those in need come to watch their worries fly away!
...And where those who are feeling helpful agree to perform <color:#1>tasks</color> on their behalf!
What sort of tasks do you mean, Sir?
You honestly don't know?<NL>Dear me! You really are new to this, aren't you!?<NL>Well, I shall swallow my amazement, and explain.
My journal, huh?<NL>Okay, I think I got it!
Your journal will also show you how many <color:#1>merit stamp cards</color> you've got.
Oh! The gatekeeper mentioned something about those! I, uh, don't think I have one, though...
Ho ho! You don't, do you?<NL>Well that is swiftly remedied!
Okay! Thank you very much, Sir!
Well, helping people out is all part of saving the world, Ollie-boy...
But before we make a start on all that do-goodery, we need to get you dressed for the job! Now, the Hootenanny said your outfit would be ready tomorrow...
So I reckon ouer best plan of action is to go and get a good night's sleep down at the <color:#1>Cat's Cradle</color>, en't it!?
Welcome to Ding Dong Dell. This is the road that leads to the royal palace. You are travelers, I take it? You must be, in those clothes...
Yes! We've come to see the King!
Ah. You're after an audience with King Tom, are you?<NL>Well, I'd be more than happy to let you through...
But I'm afraid that's just not possible at the moment.
Huh!? B-But...why?
One of the King's hapless aides has allowed His Meowjesty's beloved pet fish to escape into the palace moat.
That <color:#1>red herring</color> is the King's pride and joy—and a highly endangered species, to boot...
I doubt His Meowjesty would be able to replace this one if he were to lose it... What that aide of his was thinking, I don't know.
Anyway, to cut a long story short, everyone in the castle is busy looking for the King's <color:#1>red herring</color> at the moment. I'd advise you to come back another day.
Uh, all right...<NL>What are we going to do, Mr. Drippy?
The palace moat, is it? Hmm... If I'm not mistaken, that moat's connected to some of the rivers that run through town...
You think it could have swum all the way to town?
I reckon it's possible, yeah. Why don't we have a look in a few ponds and that, just in case? Can't do any harm, can it?
It sure can't!<NL>Gee, I hope we find that <color:#1>red herring</color>, Mr. Drippy!
Me too, Ollie-boy!<NL>Right then, let's go fishing!
Everyone in the castle is busy looking for the King's <color:#1>red herring</color> at the moment. I'm afraid I can't let you through.
Look, Ollie-boy!<NL>See that <color:#1>red thing</color> over by there?
Uh...
I reckon I've found ouer fishy friend!
...You'd better go and take a closer look, though.<NL>Just to make sure, en't it?
M-Me!? Why do I have to go over there!?
Well, who else is going to do it?<NL>Freddy the Fish Inspector!?
Come on, just hop on them rickety-looking bits of wood.<NL>You'll be fine!
Aww...gee!<NL>All right, I guess I'll try...
Oi! Where are you off to now!?<NL>The King's <color:#1>red herring</color> is over by here, mun!
How do, Saucepanhead?<NL>I don't s'pose you fancy doing us a favor, do you?
Hey! Stop distracting me! I'm busy!
...Busy? Uh... What are you busy doing, exactly?
Protecting the town from the mice, of course!
Mice? Oh yeah, I remember hearing about the mice who lived in Ding Dong Dell...
Those mice are a menace! They're always running around, getting up to no good...
But the grown-ups are too lazy to do anything about it! Most of them hardly notice when the mice steal things, and the ones that do don't seem to care!
Well, Tommy Stout is not going to stand for it! I know the mice all live down in the well, so I'm standing guard here. Any mouse that comes this way is in for a battering!
Well, well! We were right about this one! He's bursting with <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>! Over to you, Ollie-boy!
Wh-What are you talking about?
Well, King Tom seems to be really short on <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> right now...
And that's where you come in, Tommy-boy!<NL>You've got loads of the stuff! If we gave some of it to King Tom, the whole town would sort itself out quick sharp!
Yeah... So we were wondering if you could share some of your <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> with us?
Of course! I'd do anything to help the King!<NL>
Thanks, Tommy!
I'm happy to give you some <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> if it's going to help King Tom get back to normal!
Wow... That was strange...<NL>Well, now I know what magic feels like!
Strange? What do you mean?
Non-wizarding types en't used to spells, see, Ollie-boy. They don't know what to make of them half the time.
So, does this mean King Tom's going to be all right now, Oliver?
Yes! And once the King's back to normal, everyone else should start feeling better, too!
That's right, mun! Youer <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> is going to put a spring in everyone's step, en't it!?
That's great to hear!<NL>Until then, though, I'd better stay here and keep an eye out for mice!
All right! See you later, Tommy!
Hm? Mmmyoh... You again.<NL>One is becoming rather tired of these constant interruptions...
S-Sorry, Your Meowjesty.<NL>It's just, we have something for you...
Yeah, we picked it out especially for you, Catface! It'll get rid of that tiredness of youers in no time! Give you a new lease of life, it will! Strong teeth, glossy fur—
I-I'm not sure that's—
Mmmyohhh! That sounds just the ticket!<NL>This accursed fatigue will be the death of one.<NL>Dealing with all these visitors has taken its toll...
Not to worry, Youer Meowjesty!<NL>A little bit of <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> is all you need, en't it!?
Mmm? One thought you were going to give one something to cure one's blasted fatigue?
Come on, Ollie-boy! Get youer wand out and give the King his <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> back, en't it!?
Caw, it's you! His Meowjesty informed me that you would be coming. He instructed me to sell you whatever you require—and I'm more than happy to cawoperate!
So have a rook around! I'm sure you'll find something here with which to <color:#1>equip your familiars</color>.
...Equip my familiars?<NL>How do you mean, Sir?
Ah... It seems an explanation is in order.<NL>Very well, then. Here crows nothing...
Gee! Uh... Okay! As soon as I have some money, I'll start buying some accessories and stuff!
Sounds like this old bird has done a proper sales number on you, Ollie-boy!
Just remember that accessories en't the only things you can <color:#1>equip</color>. Wizards like you can use all sorts of wands, as well.
Flipping heck, mun! Speaking of wands, we need to go and get youer new wand off King Tom, en't it!? Clean forgotten, I had!
Yeah, I guess he's probably found it by now!
I reckon so, Ollie-boy. Come on, let's head for the <color:#1>palace</color>!
Mmmyaaahhh... (yawn)<NL>One has already told you: you may not have one's wand!
Thank you for everything!<NL>One shall go and seek out one's wand immediately.
I had hoped that His Meowjesty would be overjoyed to have his beloved red herring returned to him. Alas, he seems as listless as ever...
It's been a long while since King Tom was so full of life! What in the world did you do to him!?
Today's a fine day for mouse-thwacking!<NL>The only question is...what to thwack them with!
Hopefully now King Tom and everyone else can get back to normal again!
That shop there is Swift Solutions, where people go to ask for help if something's purrturbing them.
If you feel like helping a needy purrson or two, go and take a look at the Errand Board inside. Solve someone's purroblem, and they'll almost always reward you.
Well, young man, what do you think of Ding Dong Dell? Plenty of greenery, isn't there?
It's just a shame that everyone's become so idle of late.<NL>I wonder what's happened to them all...
(sigh) I just don't feel like I've got any energy to do anything...
Nobody seems to have any energy these days...
What a glorious day.<NL>I wish I could take a minute just to lie on the grass...
I wish there were something I could do to make this porch more welcoming...
See that raven-shaped shop over there?<NL>That's the Cawtermaster's Store, where you can buy weapons and armor.
Not that a young fellow like you should have any need for things like that...
They say their equipment's familiar-friendly, but I don't see how. Some of those axes are twice the size of most creatures!
Oh! You're a new face around here!<NL>Where have you come from, then?
The laundry's done and the house is spotless...<NL>Now for the shopping!
Wow! Nice outfit!<NL>Where did you get that!?
Hey, have you changed your clothes...?
Why did you go and do that!?<NL>I really liked your old look!
Hello there, young man.<NL>Can I tempt you to a piece of fresh fruit?
The shop that looks like an owl is called the Hootique.
I wonder why they chose that name...
King Tom used to come and play with me and my friends all the time!
But he hasn't come out of his castle for ages now. It's really boring without him...
Welcome to Ding Dong Dell!
If you're looking for the royal palace, it's straight down this road.
If you keep following this road, you'll eventually come to the royal palace.
What a lovely outfit!<NL>Your shirt is such a purretty shade of yellow!
Oh... Have you got new clothes?
Shame. That yellow shirt suited you purrfectly...
I do worry about my boys. Every time they go out to play, they come back with fresh cuts and bruises.
My colleague's back to normal now, thank goodness!
Thank you for your help!<NL>I don't think I've ever felt so full of life!
Finally! I thought they'd never let us in!
Yay! Pee-pee time!
At last! I just hope the Hootique hasn't sold out of the things I need!
Oh dear. I'm very late...<NL>Mother won't be best pleased about this...
My wife does so much for me...<NL>She really is a wonderful woman.
This is the best spot for a breather in all of Ding Dong Dell. Why don't you join me for a bit?
I'm afraid there's no way I can allow such a suspicious-looking pair of travelers to enter the royal palace.
The royal palace is this way.
Your clothes are very...unusual.<NL>Where are you from?
I'm afraid I can't let you in at the moment.
I'm afraid His Meowjesty is not receiving any visitors at the moment.
The Grave of the Sage is down this way. You're welcome to go and have a look, but please be respectful.
You'll never believe the things I learned today! School is so much fun! I almost purrefer it to playing! Almost.
Folks around here tell their children that the King of the Mice lives down Ding Dong Well...
It's only a story, but the thought alone is enough to send a shiver down my spine...
A little while ago, I received a letter summoning me for an audience with King Tom, so I dutifully made the journey here, all the way from the far side of the kingdom...
But now they say he doesn't want to see anyone! What am I going to do!?
They say King Tom spends all day lounging around in his palace...
I bet it's great being a king...
My father works in King Tom's palace!<NL>He's the one wearing the helmet!
Oh no! I've left the washing out!
Another fine day!<NL>Working weather, I call this!
The Tug o' Tail Tourney is starting soon...<NL>I've got to start purracticing!
This is a statue of one of King Tom's heroic ancestors.
His Meowjesty's going to have to stop lounging around all day if he wants a statue made of him!
You know the pots we've got dotted about all over town? Well, you should purrobably have a look inside them every now and again!
You never know when you might find something interesting! Or plain purrculiar.
Ahhh... I don't know what's come over me lately...
I'm just full of doom and gloom...

Oh, it's you! Thank goodness!<NL>You have to help us! Something terrible has happened!
Flipping heck, mun! Don't tell me old King Tom's gone and got his heart broken again!?
No no, His Meowjesty's heart is in good working order. As far as I know...
As far as you know...?
After you restored His Meowjesty's missing enthusiasm, he was determined to find his old wand, so that he could give it to you by way of a reward.
So determined, in fact, that he said he would go and look for it himself...
Well, that's good, en't it?<NL>What's all the fuss about?
His Meowjesty has disappeared!
Eh!?
The gatekeepers swear that he hasn't left Ding Dong Dell, and yet he's nowhere to be found!
Hmm... I smell a rat by here, Ollie-boy.<NL>Well, I s'pose there's only one thing for it, eh?
Uh... What's that Mr. Drippy?
A spot of investigating, en't it!?<NL>Righto, Helmetface. You and youer mates keep an eye on the castle—we're going looking for clues!
Oh! Er... Yes!<NL>Understood!
But where do we look, Mr. Drippy?
Don't worry, Ollie-boy! You know the place. You know it very well, in fact! Come on, I'll tell you more when we're outside.
Uh... Okay...
Please, proceed with your investigation!<NL>In the meantime, I shall ensure that the castle is thoroughly searched!
Did you give some of my enthusiasm to King Tom? Does that mean he's going to be as enthusiastic as me now!?
That shop there is Swift Solutions, where people go to ask for help if something's purrturbing them.
If you feel like helping a needy purrson or two, go and take a look at the Errand Board inside. Solve someone's purroblem, and they'll almost always reward you.

I've heard King Tom's full of enthusiasm these days. Perhaps that'll put a spring in people's step.
What a glorious day.<NL>I wish I could take a minute just to lie on the grass...
The entrance to Ding Dong Well is just down these stairs.
Children aren't purrmitted in there, though—it's too dangerous.
See that raven-shaped shop over there?<NL>That's the Cawtermaster's Store, where you can buy weapons and armor.
You'll be needing some if you want to venture outside of town!
Oh! You're a new face around here!<NL>Where have you come from, then?
The guards are frantically running around looking for someone. I wonder who it could be?
That's the shopping done.<NL>Time to make a start on dinner!
Hey, have you changed your clothes...?
Why did you go and do that!?<NL>I really liked your old look!
There's some kind of commotion happening in the palace. I'll go and have a look later on...
Hello there, young man.<NL>Can I tempt you to a piece of fresh fruit?

Well, he's definitely not around here...<NL>And he's not in the castle either...
Oh dear... I just don't know where to look...
I don't know where King Tom could have gone.<NL>He seems to have just disappeared!
Muuummy! I'm huuungry!
Oh dear. I think I've forgotten my shopping list...
I don't mean to boast, but my wife must be the finest cook in the Summerlands!
You're always running around, looking busy...<NL>You should try taking it easy once in a while!
Where in the world could he be...?
He just...vanished!
The Grave of the Sage is down this way. You're welcome to go and have a look, but please be respectful.
Has King Tom really gone missing!? Meouch!
King Tom summoned me here from my village...
But now people are saying that he's gone missing!
They say King Tom spends all day lounging around in his palace...
I bet it's great being a king...
My daddy works in the palace, and he says King Tom is asleep most of the time!
Oh no! I've left the washing out!
I saw a big group of guards running out of the palace just now. I wonder what's going on...
Another fine day!<NL>Working weather, I call this!
What are all these guards doing running around!?
This isn't...the invasion, is it?
The Tug o' Tail Tourney is starting soon...<NL>I've got to start purracticing!
This is a statue of one of King Tom's heroic ancestors.
Perhaps our King can start following in his footsteps now that he's got his enthusiasm back!
You know the pots we've got dotted about all over town? Well, you should purrobably have a look inside them every now and again!
You never know when you might find something interesting! Or plain purrculiar.
Ahhh... I don't know what's come over me lately!
I'm just full of vim and vigor in equal measure!
I just don't know where King Tom could have got to...
Surely he hasn't ventured outside his beloved Ding Dong Dell...?

Hey, Oliver! I think I just heard King Tom's voice!<NL>It was coming from down Ding Dong Well!
H-Huh!?<NL>Ding Dong Well!?
Yes! I could hear it coming from the other side of that gate! It was definitely King Tom, I'm sure of it!
Ding Dong Well, eh...?<NL>You said there were mice living down by there, en't it?
Yes! The place is full of mice!<NL>That's why I'm standing here, keeping guard!
Mice and cats really don't get along, you see...
Oh, knickers... I know what's happened!
King Tom's been kidnapped by the mice!
K-Kidnapped!?
That's right! You saw how Timmy went after them mice in youer world? Well, in this world by here, the tables have turned!
It's the only explanation, mun! Crikey, it's a good job I'm here to put two and two together for you, en't it!?
If King Tom's been kidnapped...<NL>We need to rescue him!
Are you going down Ding Dong Well, Oliver?<NL>Then I'm coming with you!
Don't be daft, mun! This is a job for professionals, en't it? Not some underage vigilante with a saucepan for a helmet!
I'll be okay!<NL>I'll have my friend with me!
Hey, Ollie-boy, it looks like you can get that new familiar of youers to <color:#1>Psyche Up!</color>
I-I can? Gee...<NL>Um...what does that mean, Mr. Drippy?
Well... It means it sort of builds up its strength for a bit, en't it? So it can give the baddies a proper whacking, like.
Once a familiar's <color:#1>psyched up</color>, instead of just attacking like normal, you can let it <color:#1>Go Wild!</color>
And when a familiar <color:#1>goes wild</color>, it attacks for longer and does loads more damage.
Gee, that sounds real neat!
It gets better, Ollie-boy! This new technique of yours will make it easier to <color:#1>cancel enemies' actions</color> as well!
Cancel enemies', uh... What?
Yeah, mun. I should have told you about this earlier, I s'pose... Some creatures have got some pretty tasty tricks up their sleeves, see.
But give them a whack when they're getting ready to try one, and they won't be able to pull it off. It'll be canceled, en't it?
Canceling enemy actions like this is much easier when you <color:#1>go wild</color>, so it's a good way to keep youerself safe from harm, and all.
The only thing is, familiars that can <color:#1>psyche up</color> can't <color:#1>defend</color> for toffee. It just en't in their nature, the feisty little blighters.
Anyway, now that you've got two little mates, you'll soon see for youerself that all creatures are different!
I-I guess I will!
It looks like the gate's locked, Ollie-boy...
But the King's down there! And we don't have a key!<NL>What are we going to do!?
Calm down, mun! You don't need a key—youer a wizard, en't it!? Just cast that spell old King Tom taught you!
You think I can open it using magic!?<NL>I could give it a try, I guess...
We need to unlock that gate, Ollie-boy! And I reckon King Catpants gave you just the spell for the job!
My familiar is yours now, Oliver!<NL>I hope he comes in handy!
I've searched every room in the palace, but the King is nowhere to be found. I only hope your investigation does not prove similarly fruitless...
That shop there is Swift Solutions, where people go to ask for help if something's purrturbing them.

Zzz... (snore) Zzz...
What in the world is all this commotion!?
Someone said they heard the King's voice coming from Ding Dong Well. But what could he possibly be doing down there!?
Don't go anywhere near Ding Dong Well, whatever you do. I've heard it's full of monsters!
King Tom hasn't really gone down into Ding Dong Well, has he? But he'll get his fur all wet! How purrfectly dreadful!
Why would King Tom go down Ding Dong Well?<NL>I just don't understand it...
Do you know what's going on?<NL>If you do, you have to tell me! Please!
That's the shopping done.<NL>Time to make a start on dinner!
Is there something happening down in Ding Dong Well? I'll have to go and take a look...
Hello there, young man.<NL>Can I tempt you to a piece of fresh fruit?
The shop that looks like an owl is called the Hootique.
I wonder why they chose that name...
I wish I could be brave like Tommy Stout...
Welcome to Ding Dong Dell!
If you keep following this road, you'll eventually come to the royal palace.
Oh... Have you got new clothes?
That yellow shirt was really cute...
That's all the chores done...<NL>Time to go shopping!
It's lucky my colleague's back to his old self, what with the panic up at the palace. We all need to be extra vigilant!
Thank you for your help!<NL>I don't think I've ever felt so full of life!
Hey! Where do you think you're going!?
Don't go anywhere near that well!<NL>It's dangerous!
I hope you're not thinking of going down into Ding Dong Well...
Muuummy! I'm reeeally huuungry!
Is something happening down in Ding Dong Well?
I don't mean to boast, but my wife must be the finest cook in the Summerlands!
You're always running around, looking busy...<NL>You should try taking it easy once in a while!
Oh, it's you!<NL>I don't know if you've heard, but the King's gone missing!
I don't suppose you could help us look for him, could you?
No one knows where His Meowjesty could have gone. He just...disappeared!
The Grave of the Sage is down this way. You're welcome to go and have a look, but please be respectful.
Has King Tom really gone missing!? Meouch!
Folks around here tell their children that the King of the Mice lives down Ding Dong Well...
It's only a story, but the thought alone is enough to send a shiver down my spine...
It doesn't look like I'll be meeting King Tom for a while...
People are saying he's gone missing!
They say King Tom spends all day lounging around in his palace...
I bet it's great being a king...
My daddy works in the palace, and he says King Tom is asleep most of the time!
I saw a big group of guards running out of the palace just now. I wonder what's going on...
What are all these guards doing running around!?
This isn't...the invasion, is it?
The Tug o' Tail Tourney is starting soon...<NL>I've got to start purracticing!
This is a statue of one of King Tom's heroic ancestors.
When I look at it, I can't help wondering what has become of His Meowjesty...
You know the pots we've got dotted about all over town? Well, you should purrobably have a look inside them every now and again!
You never know when you might find something interesting! Or plain purrculiar.
Ahhh... I don't know what's come over me lately!
I'm just full of vim and vigor in equal measure!

Look lively, Ollie-boy!<NL>There's a monster coming youer way!<NL>
Well, let's deal with it quickly and go look for the King!
That's the spirit! And remember, you've got the other familiar that lad gave you now as well, en't it?
Battles should be a bit easier with two of the little blighters on youer team! Double trouble!
Neato!
Hmm... I reckon it might be worth trying to light these, Ollie-boy... It's helluva damp in here, though... The flames won't last long...
Same again, is it? There don't seem to be any other lamps near this one, though...
What's this lamp doing over by here, then...?
And another lamp by here...<NL>That's three by my count...
Wait a minute! I see what's going on here!<NL>We've got to get them all lit at the same time, en't it!?
Now, which one should we light first...?

Oi, Ollie-boy! You got a spell that turns back time for stuff, en't it?
There's no jumping on that mushroom.<NL>We'll have to look for another way round.
...Hold on a minute! I just had a brainwave!<NL>We can make these mushrooms grow with magic, en't it?
You need to use that spell from before, en't it? You know, the one that got that dried-up tree with the egg in looking all perky again.
Hey... This looks kinda familiar...
'Course it does, you plonker—it's a page from the Wizards' Companion!
And it's finders keepers round these parts. That's the law of the jung—er, forest... You know what I mean, just<NL>grab it.
Neato!
That's three whole familiars, you got now, en't it, Ollie-boy? And look at that—this one can <color:#1>evade</color> attacks and all!
"Evade"...?<NL>Is that some kind of trick?
Yeah, I s'pose you could call it that. It's like <color:#1>defending</color>, only you don't take any damage.
The only thing is, it's proper quick, so you have to be a bit nifty with youer timing.
But then youer getting pretty tasty at the old fighting lark, en't it? In fact, I might as well let you in on another little trick of the trade while we're here.
Neato! What is it?
Well, what it is is, if you do an attack at the exact moment an enemy's attacking you, you'll hit back with what's known as a <color:#1>counterattack</color>.
And if that works, youer enemy will be so stunned, they'll just sit there and let you whack them even more! Tidy, eh?
You can tell when the perfect time to counterattack is because <color:#1>the little "Attack" bubble down in the corner will flash blue</color>.
It sounds a little complicated...<NL>But I'll do my best, Mr. Drippy!
Goo...?
Gooo!

Where d'you reckon this crystal's going to be, then,<NL>Ollie-boy? It looks like we'll have a fight on ouer<NL>hands if we try and head further into town...
B-But Mr. Drippy! We can't fight the people of<NL>Ding Dong Dell!
I know that, mun, but we don't have much choice, is it? You'll just have to, I dunno...knock them out gently or something. Leave no lasting damage, like.
As long as they're still breathing, Pea's spell should turn them back to normal!
Yeah, I guess you're right. The crew of the Iron Wyvern were okay in the end, huh...
We just need to remember that Ding Dong Dell here got a proper bucketful of that horrible ash stuff emptied on it.
Hang around for too long, and we'll end up like these other wretches, Pea or no Pea...
Gee, I hadn't thought of that...<NL>Then we have to find that black crystal quickly!
Right. Now, I heard the ash fell on <color:#1>Al Mamoon</color> and <color:#1>Hamelin</color> as well...
I reckon we should probably head straight there once we've finished over by here. What do you reckon,<NL>Ollie-boy?
Good idea, Mr. Drippy!<NL>We have to save those people!
Hey, did you hear!? King Tom went down Ding Dong Well to give the leader of the mice a battering! I knew he hadn't been kidnapped!
Looks like you didn't need to go and rescue him after all!
Hello, Oliver! How's my familiar been?<NL>I hope you're taking good care of him!
I saw a little mouse scurrying around near the Cawtermaster's Store! It's up to no good, Oliver, I just know it!
I've decided to get myself some of the world's strongest familiars and deal with those pesky mice once and for all! Which ones would you pick, Oliver?
I was all set to take down the King of the Mice today...but I can't find him anywhere!
Oh... Has it stopped snowing already?<NL>I was looking forward to a good snowball fight...
It turns out the little mouse I saw near the Cawtermaster's Store was running an errand for the shopkeeper! Maybe they're not all bad, eh?
I caused you all sorts of trouble, didn't I...?
But I'm going to make it up to you! I'll even let you have a go on my Cloud Sweeper when it's finished!
We might both be mice, but I'm nothing like that nasty Hickory Dock. He's much bigger, for a start!
Look, I know what he did was bad...but I can't help being impressed by any mouse who stands up to a cat!
(pant) I just got the fright of my life! (pant)<NL>There I was, minding my own business, and this crazy kid starts chasing after me with a broom!
(pant) The funny thing is... (pant) ...all I could think about was sticking an engine on it! (sigh) I wish my Cloud Sweeper was finished!
As soon as things started getting dark, I went and hid in Ding Dong Well...
Hickory Dock was hiding down there as well, looking absolutely terrified.
He kept shouting, "I knew it!" and something about how King Tom had been a monster all along.
The Mamooni air force has got the coolest Cloud Sweepers in the whole world!
I heard they were going to be deployed somewhere near here. I hope I get to see one!
Our kingdom owes you a great deal!<NL>You'll always be welcome here!
The people of this kingdom are bursting with enthusiasm, and it's all thanks to you!
Al Mamoon lies on the other side of a forest known as Golden Grove.
It is a city whose size easily exceeds that of one's own beloved Ding Dong Dell. Its ruler is also rather...
Well, you shall soon see for yourself.
Goodness! It has been a while, young Oliver!<NL>Were you able to meet the Great Sage Rashaad?
One has been living one's life with what can only be described as gusto since one saw you last. You really did put a spring in one's step!
One has heard great things about you, Oliver!<NL>You extricated the Emperor of Hamelin from his pit of despond, did you not?
It has been many years since one's first and only state visit to the Pig Iron Empire... Such horrible smog! One has never been so grateful for the clean air of Ding Dong Dell.
How are things, Oliver?<NL>Your exploits are the talk of the town—and beyond!
Indeed, as honorary editor of the Daily Yarn, one can say with some confidence that your adventure is the biggest story since the Great Mouse Revolt!
Well, what do you say? One's claws allow one to be quite the craftsman, eh?
Some have mocked the Clarion's unusual shape—but they clearly have neither aesthetic sense, nor an appreciation of fine craftsmanship!
Ah! One sees that the Clarion is complete!<NL>One supposes the Emperor of Hamelin is entitled to some of the credit for said achievement...
But it is to you whom the credit for uniting the three kingdoms truly belongs, young Oliver. One had never thought the day would come...
Ah, Oliver... You have undergone a transformation before one's very eyes.
One remembers the little boy who came to one's kingdom looking for a wand. That boy is but a distant memory now...
Oliver, one must apologize from the bottom of one's heart... One had been hoping to give you a proper send off...
But then that accursed ash started falling, and one became...well, one became a monster!
The Ivory Tower...<NL>That is where you shall find the one responsible for all this suffering, Oliver!
Helped in no small part by your gift of enthusiasm, one has rallied one's troops in readiness for the final battle. The armies of Ding Dong Dell await your orders!
That shop there is Swift Solutions, where people go to ask for help if something's purrturbing them.
If you feel like helping a needy purrson or two, go and take a look at the Errand Board inside. Solve someone's purroblem, and they'll almost always reward you.
I was in Swift Solutions when it happened...
My first thought was to go outside and see what was going on, but the Taskmaster outright forbade me to leave. He said curiosity would be the death of me...
Zzz... (snore) Zzz...
You know, I've never felt so full of life!
It's great to see people with a bit of a spring in their step again!
What a glorious day.<NL>I wish I could take a minute just to lie on the grass...
The entrance to Ding Dong Well is just down these stairs.
Children aren't purrmitted in there, though—it's too dangerous.
I must have fainted when the snow started falling. When I came to, I was down in Ding Dong Well...
It turns out it's not that dangerous after all!
See that raven-shaped shop over there?<NL>That's the Cawtermaster's Store, where you can buy weapons and armor.
They say their equipment's familiar-friendly, but I don't see how. Some of those axes are twice the size of most creatures!
It was the Cawtermaster who gave me a shake to wake me up. He said I'd been asleep for ages...
I know he looks a bit scary, but he's a good egg really.
Oh! I know you! You're that wizard boy!<NL>I bet you know loads of difficult spells...
Ah, the wizard returns! You know, it still amazes me that such an ordinary-looking young man could be so powerful. It's actually rather inspiring!
That's the shopping done.<NL>Time to make a start on dinner!
I heard there were some people called "forest dwellers" living in some woods to the east of Ding Dong Dell.
I can't imagine living without a roof over your head...
I don't suppose you've still got your old outfit, have you?
Those things that went around your shoulders to stop your trousers falling down—I could do with a set of those...
Hello there, young man.<NL>Can I tempt you to a piece of fresh fruit?
Hello there, young man.<NL>Can I tempt you with a piece of fresh fruit?
Last week, I read a book called "The Forest Dwellers."
It was all about these people who live in trees...<NL>I wonder if they're real...
The Hootenanny is a very kind lady.
She always listens to my stories. She says I'll write books one day, because I'm a hooge talent.
King Tom came and played with me and my friends the other day!
I wanted to play tug o' tail, but...I don't have one.
King Tom is amazing!
The other day, he lifted me and Tommy Stout onto his back using his tail!
Welcome to Ding Dong Dell!
If you keep following this road, you'll eventually come to the royal palace.
I heard a lot of strange noises coming from the castle... I hope everything's all right...
I like touching noses with people, but not when they're sticky...
That's all the chores done...<NL>Time to go shopping!
My colleague's back to normal now, thank goodness!
A local merchant told me he delivered a job lot of gunpowder to Kublai Khan's hideout. I was a little bit worried at first...
But it turns out it was for a fireworks display!<NL>Now I'm really excited!
Thanks again for your help!<NL>Here, let me give you a little tidbit of information in return...
Have you heard of the forest dwellers?<NL>They're a tribe of famously warmhearted people who live in woodlands all over the world.
I'm told a few of them live in the northeastern part of the Rolling Hills, as it happens. It might be worth seeking them out when you have a minute.
I'm sure you've noticed that our army is nothing compared to Hamelin's...
But don't worry! We're confident in our ability to drive away monsters, invaders, and unwelcome guests!
Muuummy! I'm reeeally huuungry!
My big brother gave me a pony!
A real, live pony!
Have you already finished your sandwich, darling?<NL>Dear me! Wherever do you put it all!?
Whatever are you talking about, child?
I don't mean to boast, but my wife must be the finest cook in the Summerlands!
You're always running around, looking busy...<NL>You should try taking it easy once in a while!
(yawn) Hm? Did I...fall asleep?<NL>I think I dreamed I was a fish...
Thank you for everything!
Everyone's so relieved that the King's got his enthusiasm back.
I'm ever so grateful for what you did.
Hopefully one day I'll get the chance to return the favor.
The royal palace is this way.
King Tom is a generous and tolerant leader...<NL>But I'd still advise you not to make a nuisance of yourselves.
King Tom appears to have fully recovered.<NL>Thank you.
The Grave of the Sage is down this way. You're welcome to go and have a look, but please be respectful.
The Grave of the Sage is down this way. You're welcome to go and have a look, but make too much noise—it'll make the Sage angry.
I'm serious! I had a dream about him the other night, and he was furious...
Purrhaps we could play together sometime?
I had this dream where I turned into a fish—with big lips, and scales, and everything! Purretty strange, eh?
They say the King of the Mice lives down Ding Dong Well...
But the last I heard, somebody went and gave him a good whacking. I doff my cap to them, whoever they were.
I was finally granted an audience with King Tom...<NL>He's just as kind as everyone says!
It's nearly time for me to head back to my village...<NL>I'd better buy some rustic garb for the people back home!
The climate here in Ding Dong Dell is just about perfect...
No wonder everyone's so relaxed!
King Tom never used to leave the palace, but nowadays he's always out and about!
I bet it's great being a king...
...What was that fluffy stuff?
...Can girls be kings?
That fluffy stuff is called snow!<NL>It comes from cold places!
Oh no! I've left the washing out!
What a strange dream...<NL>And it lasted such a long time...
Another fine day!<NL>Working weather, I call this!
The Tug o' Tail Tourney is starting soon...<NL>I've got to start purracticing!
It's strange... I felt really strong just now...
I hope I feel the same way during the tourney!
Have you heard the good news about King Tom?
He's stopped lazing around the palace and is becoming a king worthy of the name. Maybe one day we'll build a statue of him as well!
I can sometimes hear King Tom's voice coming from the palace. He sounds so full of energy!
Up until recently, all you could hear was his snoring...
You know the pots we've got dotted about all over town? Well, you should purrobably have a look inside them every now and again!
You never know when you might find something interesting! Or plain purrculiar.
I must have dozed off, because I had the most purrculiar dream—lots of tasty-looking fish were wandering around town!
I couldn't catch any of them, though.<NL>So much for my purredatory instincts...
Ahhh... I don't know what's come over me lately!
I'm just full of vim and vigor in equal measure!
Ah, hello there! Oh dear, you look quite worked up... What's ruffled your feathers?
Some dirty, rotten thief's pinched ouer—<NL>HOLD ON A MINUTE! Look over by there, Ollie-boy!
It's the <color:#1>holy wood</color>!<NL>Where did you find it, Sir!?
Ah, is that what's cawt your eye? Pretty, isn't it?<NL>I thought it would make a rather nice window display!
A flipping window display!? That's holy wood, that is! Don't tell me you were planning on wedging weapons in it! You were, weren't you!?
Mr. Cawtermaster, Sir, that holy wood is ours!<NL>It was stolen from us!
Stolen!? But I've only just bought it—and for a price<NL>that would make your eyes water! Don't tell me I've<NL>been rooked!
'Fraid so, mun. Whoever sold it to you must have pinched it from us, en't it?
Gah, I should have been more cawtious! I did wonder how he could have come by such a valuable item...
So you know the person who sold it to you, Sir?
It was that <color:#1>young mouse</color>... The one with the glasses. He's always coming round here hawking his wares...
Glasses...?
But I never thought he was a thief...
No. Just beak 'cause you say he's guilty, that doesn't make it true. If you want me to believe you, you're going to have to bring me some proof!
B-But how can we do that...!?
There's only one thing for it, Ollie-boy! We're going to have to catch that <color:#1>mouse</color> and get him to confess!
O-Okay! Let's do that!<NL>We'll get you your proof, Sir!
Please, do it quickly!<NL>I'd hate to think I was handling stolen goods!
Eek!<NL>Leave me alone!
Eek!<NL>It's you!
Look, I'm really sorry! That thing I stole...it was really important, wasn't it?
Huh!?
What a flipping transformation, mun!<NL>Looks like this mouse really is youer pal's soul mate!
The thing is...I've already sold it... I-I sell things to the local shopkeepers, you see... I just don't know what to do...
Don't worry, Pip. Let's just explain to the shopkeeper what happened. I'm sure he'll understand.
I'm so sorry, Oliver...
You have performed enough heroic deeds for one lifetime, Oliver. One takes it you will now be returning to your own world?
Very well! Then a magnificent farewell feast will<NL>be prepared!
Well, there is no rush. Please stay and enjoy the festivities!

Mr. Rashaad, Sir! We brought it! We brought the piece of heart that your daughter is missing!

What are you, deaf or something!?<NL>He said we can fix youer daughter!

...Who are you?
Leave this place.<NL>There is nothing I can teach you.
Welcome, welcome!<NL>All of our produce is the very freshest!
You are visitors to our city, are you not?<NL>Then I shall give you a most magnificent discount!
(sigh) It is most ferociously hot again today...<NL>Oh, for a cold snack of some description!
By the beards of the Ancients!<NL>Your head is uncovered, child!
The sun of the desert is most merciless—you must protect yourself!
Do you like what you see?<NL>It is of the highest quality, of course!<NL>Fresh from the southern port of Castaway Cove!
Your clothes are most...unique, stranger.<NL>Are you not terribly hot?
Have you come to try our delicious babanas, friend? If you have not tried them, you must! They are truly a wonder!
Esther seems most unhappy of late.<NL>I wonder what could be wrong...
Did you know that there is a most terrifying mountain of fire to the west of here? Its name is Old Smoky.
We children are not permitted to approach it, for fear that we may melt!
It is not fair!<NL>Why can I not have another babana split?
Praise the Ancients!<NL>Milk! Delicious milk!
Welcome, welcome, to Al Mamoooooon!<NL>Enjoy our babanas, and come back soooooon!
I will be a most famous writer of songs when I am older. You must come to all of my performances!
You are not of this realm, are you, child?<NL>Are you a traveler, perhaps?
If you wish to sample our famed and most delicious babanas, you must follow this road to the end.
Wow, it's beautiful here!
I just love going on holiday!<NL>And hot places are my absolute favorite!
Ahh, I feel most refreshed and invigorated! There is nothing more magnificent than a visit to the spa after a hard day of work!
Ohhh, my... It's just too hot for me here. ...What's that? A Mamooni like me should be used to the heat by now?
I'm no Mamooni! I'm from dear old Ding Dong Dell!
It seems that Old Smoky has grown yet more dangerous of late...
I pray that nothing terrible is about to befall us...
If it grows much hotter, the milk of the fountains will curdle.
...A-ha! This gives me an idea!<NL>I shall fill bottles with water, and sell those!<NL>I will surely become most rich!
I am afraid that I cannot allow you to pass.<NL>It is not currently permitted.
If you wish an audience with Her Moojesty, you must obtain Master Abull's permission.
Yes! If only an enterprising merchant would freeze the milk of the fountains. I am sure it would be most delicious.
Milk! Milk! Get the coolest, freshest milk in all the city! Fresher than that of any other merchant!
A boy of your age is forced to travel the wide world? Such hardship for one so young! Have you sufficient money, child...?
In that case, perhaps you will purchase some of our fine fabrics, while you are here?
Without the oasis, those who travel the desert would surely perish.
This is why it is sacred to the people of our fair city.
By the Ancients, what a handsome young man! We are blessed! Please do not hesitate to tell me if any of our wares catch your eye!
If my senses do not deceive me, you are a wizard.<NL>I am correct, no?
Which means you must be here to see Rashaad.<NL>So sorry, child, I fear Rashaad is...no matter.
Surely a person who could cool the milk of the fountains would become richer still?
Very well, dearest. I cannot bear to see you unhappy.<NL>You shall have all that you wish for...
That young seller of fabrics is a most fierce salesperson. The girls of Al Mamoon are not to be trifled with!
Ho ho ho! There is none more spoiled than our beloved grandchild!
Haa... Haa...
I will soon compete in the Oasis Race!<NL>I must practice all that I can, or I shall not win!
From where do you come, friend?<NL>Why are you here in Al Mamoon?
Hm? You have come from Ding Dong Dell?<NL>Ahh, I am so jealous!
Al Mamoon offers you its most humble of welcomes.
Traversing the desert is most tiring. You must enjoy our hospitality awhile before continuing on your journey.
I am the greatest fan of milk in all the land!<NL>That is why this is my most favorite place!
People say that the palace is a cool and sheltered place...
(sigh) I am so very jealous of the Cowlipha...
I like to play here by the fountain.<NL>It is a cool and shaded place.
Husband! Why do you not listen to me!?
Again you have purchased goods that we cannot possibly sell!

It's time for the Test of Strength.<NL>Are you wimps ready?
That's what I like to hear!<NL>Good luck in there—you'll need it.
"No"? Do you need time to get ready, or are you just scared? Ha ha! Scaredy-cats!
Have you decided which one you want to be your new familiar yet?
Ready? We might as well do it the same way as you do when you tame a creature in a normal battle.
In case you've forgotten, that means you have to beat the creature up, then get Esther to play it a <color:#1>serenade</color> on her harp.
And don't wet your pants—I've told them not to attack you so you wimps don't get scared and run away!
Now, to the battlefield!
Have you still not decided? Great. That's just the kind of decisive attitude a hero needs...
Look, you don't need to worry about missing out—you can always tame the ones you don't get here out in the wild.
Umbopa will explain the Trials.<NL>You will listen.
There are three Trials.
The first Trial is the Test of Wits.<NL>The second Trial is the Test of Friendship.
Pass these Trials, and there is a third Trial: the Test of Strength. It is the final Trial.
But first, you must pass the first two Trials.
The first two Trials are in the Trial rooms to the left and right of here.
To learn about these Trials, <color:#1>ask the Trial monitors in the Trial rooms</color>. Good luck in the Trials.
You want Umbopa to explain the Trials again?
Umbopa will explain the Trials. You will listen.<NL>There are three Trials.
Pass these Trials, and there is a third Trial: the Test of Strength. It is the final Trial. But first, you must pass the first two Trials.
The first two Trials are in the Trial rooms to the left and right of here. To learn about these Trials, ask the monitor birds in the Trial rooms.
Now you know about the Trials. Take care in the Trials, or it will be painful for you.
Well met.<NL>This is the Test of Wits.
The powers of perception and reflection are the keys to solving these puzzles. Show me the wisdom upon which your kind prides itself, child of man.
Yes?
The dragon sees the warrior's sword, while the bird is shown his shield, the beast, meanwhile, looks to his right, and sees an empty field.
When they who lie above are one with he that lies below, the gateway will be opened up, and onward you will go.
The bird is bound to dragon and moon, and on a star he sits. The beast links warrior, moon, and star, yet knows not where he fits.
Eh!? ...Oh, I get it. The bird has to be on top of a star, and the lines have to join it up with a moon and that dragon there, en't it?
You would abandon the Trial? Know that you will be required to begin this room anew should you return. Is this truly your wish?
...So be it.<NL>You will be returned to the Hall of the Supreme Sage forthwith.
Excellent. To admit defeat is to invite it.<NL>So long as you strive, you may yet succeed.
Excellent. You have demonstrated your wisdom, and passed the Test of Wits.
I hereby present you with proof of your achievement.
Keep your eyes and ears ever open.<NL>The knowledge you gain will serve you well.
It is not always brute force that wins the day.<NL>Often, the word is mightier than the deed.
I understand! Thank you very much!
The Trial is not yet over.<NL>Another room awaits.
You have solved the second puzzle.<NL>But how will you fare in the final room?
Be ever open to new knowledge, child of man.<NL>In wisdom lies power.
Well met.<NL>This is the Test of Friendship.
The road will open only to those who trust in each other and walk forward as one. Stand atop the glowing switches to begin.
You would abandon the Trial? Know that you will be required to begin anew should you return. Is this truly your wish?
Excellent. You have demonstrated the strength of the bond between you, and passed the Test of Friendship.
Stand together in the face of the hardships that await you, and believe in one another above all else. Do so, and you will always prevail.
We will! Thank you very much!
Trust always in your companions, child of man.<NL>In unity lies power.
Go forth. Open the door together.
What's wrong? Are you nervous or something?<NL>You need to learn to relax. I can't stand watching you squirm like that.
The more familiars you have on your side, the easier things will be out there. Taming's the name of the game!
Do you want a picture or something?<NL>Stop staring at me like that!
Talk to the back of my head all you want—I'm not listening. So SHUT UP!
The next Trial is the Test of Strength. It is the final Trial. It is different from the other Trials.
Play the <color:#1>serenade</color> with the harp.<NL>This will tame familiars.
Umbopa loves metamorphosis!<NL>Quickly! Speak to Master Solomon!
There is much danger in the world.<NL>Do not forget your purpose.
You passed the Trials! Now Umbopa can begin preparations for the <color:#1>Solosseum Series</color>!
Oi, Umbopa, you stupid great lump!<NL>I thought I told you that was a secret!
Ah! Forgive me, Master Solomon! <color:#1>Solosseum Series</color>? Umbopa does not even know what this is...
Welcome back, you lot! Well? What do you think? Things are pretty lively round here these days, aren't they?
That's because I'm holding the most amazing contest in the universe: the Solosseum Series!
Familiar keepers have come from all over the world to pit their best beasties against each other!
It's the hottest ticket on four continents!
Speak to Umbopa for all the boring details.
I hope you wimps don't embarrass yourselves too badly!
Not Umbopa first.<NL>Please speak with Master Solomon first.
My familiars are the best in the whole wide world!
I'm still only little. It's not surprising I lost. But I'm going to become the best familiar keeper in the whole wide world, you'll see!
If you defeat us, we will give you all of our delicious babanas—that is how confident we are that we will emerge victorious!
You handled our babana bunchers with the utmost skill! Truly, your knowledge of the babana is unrivaled!
The finest foods, and the most lavish cages!<NL>Nothing but the best will do for my prized familiars!
Goodness... You mean to tell me that simply throwing money at your familiars is not enough to make them strong...?
Underestimate the power of the feline forces at your peril! Purrepare to be defeated!
No faaair! We weren't purrepared! If we were ready, we would have purrevailed easily!
Hm? Do you wish to ask for my hand?<NL>I will accept only the strongest suitors!
You are most eminently strong! Hee hee! Perhaps you will visit me soon in Castaway Cove?
Not like it here...
Forest......
Must return......
Hate it here...
You don't look like too much of a challenge from where I'm standing...
Flip, mun! Youer a lot better than you look!<NL>You don't fancy teaching us a thing or two about familiar keeping, do you?
It is being too, too hot here, yes?<NL>It is not being fair on we poor tomte...
If you are facing us in the snows, you will be seeing the true tomte power, yes?
The battle between familiars is like the battle for the heart of a beautiful señorita!
We have lost the battle, but with our hats intact, the señoritas will still love us!
You shall not pass!
Not bad, eh? I sound almost like a real Hamelin guard, don’t I?
Ha! Let us fight without familiars!<NL>With this armor, you won't even scratch me!
...I beg your pardon? You can use magic? Oh, um... Terribly sorry. Perhaps another day...
Do you like my outfit? I am sure I will fight at least ten times as well in robes so fine as these!
Very well—next time, I shall have my revenge in the uniform of a Xanaduvian guardsman!

There is a Great Sage somewhere in the city of Hamelin, far to the east.
You must find this sage.<NL>And I must investigate Shadar's activities further...
Welcome, welcome!<NL>All of our produce is the very freshest!
You are visitors to our city, are you not?<NL>Then I shall give you a most magnificent discount!
(sigh) It is most ferociously hot again today...<NL>Oh, for a cold snack of some description!
It seems the dark cloud that hung over Rashaad has lifted. Thank the Ancients—I was so dreadfully worried for him!
Do you like what you see?<NL>It is of the highest quality, of course!<NL>Fresh from the southern port of Castaway Cove!
Your clothes are most...unique, stranger.<NL>Are you not terribly hot?
Have you come to try our delicious babanas, friend? If you have not tried them, you must! They are truly a wonder!
Esther is back to her usual wonderful self!<NL>I am so happy!
By the Ancients! You say you have been to Old Smoky!?
Truly, you are a hero! Tell me, was it hot?<NL>Were you scared? Tell me everything!
Did you tame a little bighorn? It is a strong and most resilient creature! Rashaad told me all about them!
It is not fair!<NL>Why can I not have another babana split?
And a chocolate-coated babana!
If I drink all of the milk, will I grow to be big and strong? Will it happen instantly, do you think?
Welcome, welcome, to Al Mamoooooon!<NL>Drink much milk, and come back soooooon!
I will be a most famous writer of songs when I am older. You must come to all of my performances!
My, this is a most beautiful color...<NL>That decides it! I will purchase this also!
I just love going on holiday!<NL>And hot places are my absolute favorite!
But I think it might be just a little too hot here...
The oasis on which our city relies has begun to dwindle of late.
We must learn to conserve water, or suffer the consequences...
Ohhh... Oh my...it's hot...<NL>But I think I might be starting to get used to it.
...No. I lied. It's ridiculous.<NL>It's absolutely, unbearably, swelteringly boiling!
It seems the danger from Old Smoky has subsided. We are safe again, thank the Ancients.
Praise be that nothing untoward occurred.
If it grows much hotter, the milk of the fountains will curdle.
...A-ha! This gives me an idea!<NL>I shall fill bottles with water, and sell those!<NL>I will surely become most rich!
I am afraid that I cannot allow you to pass.<NL>It is not currently permitted.
If you wish an audience with Her Moojesty, you must obtain Master Abull's permission.
You must persevere, and haggle to the utmost.<NL>There is no more stubborn merchant than a Mamooni!
Milk! Milk! Get the coolest, freshest milk in all the city! Fresher than that of any other merchant!
This fabric is most light and cool! Feel it! Our stock is supplied by the Cawtermaster's Store—all is entirely aboveboard and approved!
Without the oasis, those who travel the desert would surely perish.
This is why it is sacred to the people of our fair city.
In such ferocious heat, one wishes to bathe oneself most frequently. We are fortunate to have the spa at our disposal. Praise the Ancients!
By the Ancients, what a handsome young man! We are blessed! Please do not hesitate to tell me if any of our wares catch your eye!
The Taskmaster of the Swift Solutions store is most handsome, yes? In my day, he would have been inundated with offers of marriage!
Surely a person who could cool the milk of the fountains would become richer still?
Very well, dearest. I cannot bear to see you unhappy. You shall have all that you wish for...
Haa... The sun is most fierce again today...
Such heat makes one long for a cool and refreshing drink...
Ho ho ho! There is none more spoiled than our beloved grandchild!
Haa... Haa...
I will soon compete in the Oasis Race!<NL>I must practice all that I can, or I shall not win!
My father sails all over the world aboard the merchant ships of Castaway Cove. He tells me that the export of babanas is a most profitable trade.
I hope that one day we will sail the seas together.
Al Mamoon offers you its most humble of welcomes.
You must enjoy your fill of our delicious and renowned babanas, and our cool and refreshing milk!
I am the greatest fan of milk in all the land!<NL>That is why this is my most favorite place!
People say that the palace is filled to the ceiling with delicious babanas...
(sigh) I am so very jealous of the Cowlipha...
I like to play here by the fountain.<NL>It is a cool and shaded place.
Husband! Why do you not listen to me!?
Again you have purchased goods that we cannot possibly sell!

Oh-ho-ho! Well, hello there, young wizard! You have done well to find me here. How do you like my forest? It is beautiful, is it not?
The Guardian of the Woods watches over this forest. Normally, he is a tranquil soul...
But something has...changed him.<NL>He is not himself.
Oh, I do so love to chat! Visit me again and tell me of your travels, won't you?
If you tell me a nice enough story, who knows—perhaps I will reward you with a little something... Oh-ho-ho!
Old Father Oak! How do you do, Sir?<NL>It's been a long time.
Oh, hello there, young man.<NL>How very nice it is to see you again.
Now...tell me all about your travels!
Ho ho ho! So you cured the lazy cat king of Ding Dong Dell? That was no mean feat!
We sure did! And we fought the king of the mice, too! He was this big! And my familiars are getting real strong!
You are rewarding them suitably for their efforts, I trust?
I am sure Drippy has told you many times, but it bears repeating: familiars are exceedingly fond of treats.
And the more you give them, the more likely it is that they will be able to give you the help you need when you are in danger.
It is as the old saying goes: look after your familiars, and they will look after you!
I sure will, Old Father Oak!
Ho ho ho! Now, be on your way.<NL>And travel carefully...
Your journey will only become more perilous as it progresses. Be prepared!
Hello, Old Father Oak!
Oh-ho! You have come to visit me again!<NL>How nice of you! What a fine lad you are!
Well? How have you been getting on?<NL>Tell me all about it!
Ho ho ho! A new companion, hm?<NL>How very exciting!
Uh-huh! Her name is Esther!<NL>She's awful clever, and—
Oh, I see! She's CLEVER, is she!? Not like old Drippy, then? Silly old Drippy—always getting things wrong! And after all I've done! Ungrateful so-and-so...
N-No, Mr. Drippy!<NL>I didn't mean that, I was just—
Save youer breath, mun!<NL>Written all over youer innocent little face, it is!<NL>Youer lucky I'm not a sensitive soul!
I'll just have to hope there's someone out there who'll appreciate a sidekick as lovable and funny and reliable as little old me...
Now, now, children! This is no time to let the green-eyed monster get the better of us!
Oh, and now I'm a monster, is it?<NL>Kick me while I'm down, why don't you?
No, Mr. Drippy! You've got it all wrong!<NL>Gee, I don't know what I'd do without you!<NL>Please, you can't leave me! I need you!
Well, er...since you put it like that, I s'pose I could stick around a bit longer, like...
Ho ho ho! You are as susceptible to flattery as you are to jealousy, I see, Drippy! How very like you! Ho ho ho!
What are you on about, mun?<NL>That wasn't flattery, that was the truth, plain and simple!
Very well, have it your way.<NL>I am just glad to see that you are friends again.<NL>Now, on your way, and no more bickering!
You will have need of each other on the road that lies before you...
Oh-ho! Here you are again!<NL>How very nice to see you!
And how goes your journey, hm?<NL>Tell me all about it...
Oh-ho! So it was Shadar who caused Old Smoky to erupt?
It sure was! And then a monster made of magma came out of the lava, and—
It did as well! Proper terrifying, it was!
Not that we were scared, like! Bashed the beastie into submission, and saved the day, we did. Not bad, eh, Youer Leafyship?
Ho ho ho! Well now, confidence is certainly no bad thing, but do remember that pride comes before a fall, won't you?
Your journey is a dangerous one, and life is fragile.
I see I shall have to give you something to help you protect yourselves in battle.
May you overcome every hardship that faces you, and may you never give up!
I have every faith in your ability.<NL>Now go forth and continue your adventure!
Just remember not to get carried away.<NL>Especially you, fairy...
Oh-ho! Here you are again!<NL>How very nice it is to see you, young man!
And how are you faring on your adventure, hm?<NL>Tell me all about it...
Ho ho ho! So you saved the cowlipha of Al Mamoon from her all-consuming greed? Your deeds grow greater and greater!
They do a bit, though, en't it?<NL>Come on, Your Barkship! Lay it on thick!<NL>Tell us how flipping great we are!
Hey, Mr. Drippy!
Your boastfulness grows greater and greater, too, I see...
But do not let your successes go to your head.<NL>Now that you have a ship at your disposal, the world is your oyster.
And beyond the oceans lie creatures more dangerous, and battles more fierce, than any you have seen thus far.
Well, we'd best be careful, then!<NL>I've got bruises on my bruises, already.<NL>Er—not that I'm complaining, like...
Hmm... I shall give you some special medicine of my own devising.
It will cure you of all the wounds of battle.
You must look to your own well-being, even in the heat of the fray. He who heals, hopes, after all!
Ho ho ho! So you returned to the place of your birth at last, Drippy! And did your friends have to drag you there, I wonder?
Mr. Drippy's mom is as big as a mountain!<NL>Why, she's even bigger than you, Old Father Oak!
I've told you already—shut up about my flipping mam!
I'm a battle-hardened warrior, not some mummy's boy, got it?
Sure. I'm sorry... I guess we have to try and be strong, or we'll never beat Shadar, right?
Do not place too much importance on strength, Oliver. Though your path may lead to conflict, you travel in the name of friendship...and love.
You must be kind to all those you meet on your journey. You never know how they might be able to help you...
And above all, you must be kind to your companions. As long as they are beside you, no obstacle is insurmountable.
A handsome reply, as ever!<NL>Now, let me offer you some help of my own.
Thank you very much, Old Father Oak!<NL>I'll be sure to keep on trying my hardest!
You are a brave boy, and honest.<NL>Never lose that purity of heart.
And never forget that I am here to help you.<NL>Come and see me again soon!
And how are you faring on your adventure, hm?<NL>Tell me all about it!
Ho ho ho! So you have been to Hamelin?<NL>And not only there, but to the past also?
You have traveled far, little ones.
When I was but a sapling, I visited Autumnia myself.
But in those days, Hamelin was no great city. It could hardly even have been called a village...
Huh? You mean you were once a traveler like us,<NL>Old Father Oak?
Indeed I was. It must be, ohh, centuries ago now, but the Telling Stone and I still remember it fondly...
Blimey! Not even I knew that!
Well, it has been many years since I spoke of it. But the tale of our travels is an important part of the Wizard's Companion.
Would you like to read it?
Well, we can't exactly say no now, can we?
Ho ho ho! I do apologize. It was talking of your travels. It made me...nostalgic.
Don't worry, Old Father Oak. We'll keep coming here and telling you our story!
Ho ho ho! How very kind of you! Then helping your story to continue is the least I can do!
I look forward to hearing the next chapter of your tale.
Until we meet again, journey safely.
So you seek the three stones...
Yes. We heard they were spread all over the world.
Dear me... That must make things rather difficult for you, having to trudge from place to place and look for them...
Trudging? Are you having a laugh?<NL>We're traveling in style, mun!<NL>It's dragon-back or nothing for us these days!
Uh-huh!<NL>We made friends with a dragon!<NL>He can fly anywhere, and his name's Tengri!
Oh-ho! You are fortunate indeed!<NL>I myself have never been lucky enough to take to the skies...
We'll wave to you next time we're flying over the Deep Dark Wood!
Ho ho ho! I shall look forward to it!
Thank you for sharing such an exciting tale.<NL>Let me give you a little something in return.
Thank you very much, Old Father Oak!
Ahh, listening to your tales always reminds me of my travels as a sapling...
It has been many years since I spoke of it.<NL>But the tale of our travels is an important part of the Wizard's Companion.
Ho ho ho! I do apologize. It was talking of your travels. It made me...nostalgic. Well, it is time you were on your way.
The world is wide, little ones, but do not give up—you will find the stones!
Oh-ho! Hello again, young man!<NL>It is good to see you!
How goes your adventure, hm?<NL>Tell me all about it...
Oh-ho. So you found all three stones?
We sure did! We visited the Vault of Tears, and the Winter Isles, and we even chased down a ghost pirate's ship!
Ho ho ho! An adventure indeed!
And there's plenty more where that came from, Ollie-boy! You'll be sick to the teeth of adventures by the time this is over, you mark my words!
What do you mean, Mr. Drippy?<NL>I'll never get tired of having adventures!
Ho ho ho! You have come far!
To think this is the same boy who came to me without so much as a familiar to his name not so long ago!
And you must go still further. Let me give you something to help you along the way.
When evil stands in your path, do not hesitate—let the magic you have learned help you to overcome it.
I sure will, Old Father Oak!<NL>Thank you very much!
The path of the wizard is a long and winding one, but you must never give up.
Oh-ho! So the Clarion is reborn!
It sure is! The leaders of the three kingdoms all worked together to make it!
Yeah, they played their part, I s'pose, but mostly it was the Lord High Lord of the Fairies' knack for diplomacy made it happen...
Mr. Drippy! How could you say that!?
Ho ho ho! My, my!
So, Oliver... Soon you will face him at last...
...Yes.
We cannot know what awaits you, but let me give you a word of advice...
You must never give up hope. Hope will always defeat despair. And when despair is defeated, truth can shine forth.
Ooh, there's mysterious...
There is no mystery.<NL>Just do as you have always done.<NL>Stay pure of heart, and you cannot fail.
I will, Old Father Oak!
Though I know my advice to be sound, I must confess that I have never faced such trials as you do now. No, not even during my travels as a sapling.
Ho ho ho! I do apologize. In trying times, I am wont to become a little...nostalgic. Well, I shall not keep you any longer.
Remember, now: never give up hope.<NL>Good luck, Oliver.
Oh-ho! My brave young friend!<NL>It is a relief to see you safe and well!
But tell me, how did you fare?<NL>I fear you have been through much...
So, at last you know the truth...
I do... But thanks to everybody else...<NL>Thanks to my friends...I'm okay.
Thanks to your friends, and to your heart.<NL>There is no other like it, Oliver.<NL>You are a great wizard. Perhaps the greatest...
...Thank you very much.<NL>I'm so glad I met you, Old Father Oak.
Ho ho ho! The feeling is entirely mutual!
May luck go with you.<NL>You still have much to do.
Oh my! An evil ash fell on the town and turned the people into monsters?
Proper horrible, it was, Youer Tallness!
My mom and Lucien tried so hard to protect this world, and now it's in danger all over again...
I'll save it this time too, Old Father Oak, you'll see!
You are the only one who can, Oliver.
I will do what I can to help you in your fight.<NL>Here, this is for you.
Ahh, you have done so much for one so young!<NL>My own travels as a sapling pale in comparison to your heroic deeds!
Go, young Oliver.<NL>You are this world's only hope!
How goes your adventure, hm?<NL>Tell me all about it!
Oh-ho! So you saved the people of the three kingdoms from the evil ash! I'm so glad!
You should've seen the monsters though, Youer Treeness! Horrible things, they were!
King Tom turned into a massive great big cat-beast thingy, and that Lowlah turned into a huge cow creature!
How could anybody turn such kind people into such horrible things?
It was indeed an act of the gravest cruelty.<NL>...But they are themselves once more.<NL>And for that, we must give thanks.
...Yeah, I guess we should.
Now, let me give you something to help you prepare for the next great battle that lies ahead.
No matter how fearsome your enemy, with this gift, you can still win the day.
Thank you, Old Father Oak!
There is no foe you cannot overcome, Oliver.<NL>I believe in you. We all do.
Oh-ho! My brave young wizard!<NL>You have returned!
Tell me all that has happened, and leave nothing out...
So that is the true story of the White Witch?<NL>How very sad...
To labor under such a misconception for so many thousands of years...
I want to help her, but...I think the only way might be to fight her...
But fight her you must, and help her you shall.<NL>Just as you did Shadar...
The battle will not be a happy one, but you must not lose heart. To do so is to lose altogether. Do you understand?
Yes, Old Father Oak!
You are about to take part in perhaps the greatest battle ever fought... My own travels as a sapling rather pale in comparison...
The final battle awaits you, Oliver.<NL>Be strong, for all our sakes...
Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
What's going on here, eh?<NL>I've got a proper bad feeling about this...
Uh-oh! Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of<NL>something rum...
Is this something to do with the rifts that Conductor character was on about?
Knickers! What shall we do, Ollie-boy?
One of those orb thingies again, is it?
Well, we both know what'll happen.<NL>I bet you can't bring youerself to leave it be though, eh?
What'll it be, Ollie-boy?
Up for it, are you? Well, don't say I didn't warn you...
Fair enough, mun. But I can't help feeling something proper bad might happen if we don't sort this out...
Examine the black orb?
First things first, let's get ouerselves down to Ding Dong Dell!
To the Deep Dark Wood!
What about those waystone thingies, eh?<NL>There's useful!
I'm sure there's something I've forgotten to teach you... Never mind, let's go and see the Old Man of the Woods, shall we?
It's nice youer learning new things, but don't go getting better than me now, mun. I don't want you showing me up.
I wonder what's got the Guardian of the Woods so het up... It sounds like no common or garden tantrum, mun! This sounds serious!
Looks like we got ouerselves a new butty, eh?<NL>You'd best learn how to fight with familiars—and fast!
The beasties round by here are nothing, mun.<NL>They'll do for training, like, but there's much worse to come. Much worse...
If things look a bit hairy, don't be scared to heal youerself at a waystone. Better safe than sorry, eh?
There's loads we can do now, mun. The only limit is youer imagination! Well, that and youer bank balance, and youer age, and...
Don't forget to have a nose round in any treasure chests you come across, mun! You can only open the red ones for now, though...
Let's go and help that guard out, shall we?
We've got to get down to Ding Dong Dell, mun!
Pah! We finally get into Ding Dong Dell, and you come all the way back here! What are you thinking, mun?
Oi, you planning on standing out like a sore flipping thumb forever, mun? You need a new outfit, and I don't mean tomorrow...
Swift Solutions, we need. Does it look like we're going to find it here? Does it? Well, does it? I'll give you a hint—NO!
The Cat's Cradle's just there as you go into Ding Dong Dell, mun. What are we doing all the way out by here?
Come on, mun! Let's go and pick up youer new outfit! I can't wait to see what the old girl's thrown together for you...
All we need to do is head down to the palace in Ding Dong Dell. That should be easy enough, even for you!
We need to find that red herring sharpish, mun! Don't want it flipping and flopping all the way to the ocean now, do we?
Now we've caught the flipping thing, can we please hurry up and deliver it?
Who exactly were you planning on getting some enthusiasm off round by here then, hm?
Oi, Ollie-boy! En't we s'posed to be on the hunt for someone with enthusiasm to spare?
Planning on delivering that enthusiasm we found any time this century, are you?
Right, enough of the sightseeing!<NL>Let's get ouerselves down to the Cawtermaster's Store, shall we?
Shouldn't we be over by the palace in Ding Dong Dell getting ouerselves a new wand?
We've got to go over to youer world to find out what's wrong over by here!
We're not going to find Timmy round by here, are we, now?
Where do you think youer going, hm?<NL>What about old Timmy-boy?
Reckon youer going to find him round here, do you? I flipping don't!
To Ding Dong Dell, and down Ding Dong Well!<NL>That's where we need to be going, mun!
We finally get it open, and you come running off over by here! Youer a funny one, Ollie-boy, and no mistake...
What's the matter with you, eh?<NL>Shouldn't you be looking for the King?
Southward we go, to Golden Grove!
After Golden Grove, it's on to Al Mamoon!
Oi! En't you s'posed to be restoring the Spring of Life to its former glory?
En't we s'posed to be going and meeting that Rashaad bloke?
Come on, Ollie-boy! Let's get over to youer world!
Get a move on! We've got to help Rusty, en't it!?
Haven't you got something you need to tell Myrtle?
Let's get ouer bottoms in gear and get back to Al Mamoon, shall we?
Are you sure the Temple of Trials is this way?
What's wrong with you, mun? We need to go and see the Supreme Sage, en't it?
We're going nowhere fast until we pass those Trials, mun.
Come on, mun! Let's get down to the Temple and take that third Trial!
The Supreme Sage is waiting for us, en't he?
I know Solomon said to take a break, but that's no reason to go running off flipping miles away now, is it, mun?
We're s'posed to be heading for Al Mamoon, en't it?
We'll never stop that volcano from erupting if we don't get a flipping move on!
Reckon we've got a thing or two to be going and telling Rashaad, don't you?
Onward, to Castaway Cove!
We need to get after that dirty rotten thief, en't it?
Just going to let that stinking thief run off with the pot, are we?
Oi! Where are you off to, eh? The magic words for that pot are in the flipping Wizard's Companion, mun!
Come on, mun! Let's get down to Castaway Cove and set sail on the high seas!
We need to get that Cowlipha of Al Mamoon to let us borrow her boat, en't it?
Fancy taking a look at the Cat's Cradle they've got over in Al Mamoon? I hear it's a proper snazzy one.
Let's get over to youer world, shall we?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, en't there?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, mun!
We need to head over to Al Mamoon and find us some restraint, mun!
Don't you like Al Mamoon or something?<NL>We need to head back there, mun!
Let's go and give old Cowface her restraint back, shall we?
If we head down to Castaway Cove, we should be able to ride that boat now, en't it?
Oi! We need to get back to Castaway Cove and retrieve ouer stolen goods!
Come on, mun! We need to go down to Castaway Cove and find us some restraint!
Let's go and hand over that restraint we got ouerselves, shall we?
That boat's going to leave without us if we don't get a flipping move on! Castaway Cove, and don't spare the ulks!
All aboard! Let's go and hit the high seas, en't it!
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?

Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.

Knickers! Forgot my insect repellent, didn't I?
This here is the Deep Dark Wood, so-called because it's shallow, well-lit, and sparsely wooded.
Proper clever, old Treeface is. Not as clever as me, like, but you'd do well to listen to what the old codger has to say.

Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä shall we, mun?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
The floor's helluva slippery by here, Ollie-boy.<NL>Mind you don't come a cropper!
I can smell something up ahead, mun...
These blinking sewers all look the same, mun.<NL>Better keep a close eye on youer map, I reckon.
Looks like some mice are living down by here, Ollie-boy.
So this is what a red herring looks like, is it?<NL>I've never seen one before, like...
Lay off for a bit, will you? Even us fairies need a bit of time to ouerselves now and again...
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
No rush, Ollie-boy. Let's take it easy for a bit.
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
Let's start the new day as we mean to go on, shall we? Best foot forward, and last one in's a rotten egg!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
What's up with you, eh?
Want me to say something, do you? Sorry, mun, I got nothing for you. Not a sausage. Nada. Diddly-squat. Zero. Er...zilch.
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
Youer not... Ha ha! You are, en't it?<NL>Youer flipping lost! Nice one, Cyril!

Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
There's something funny going on by here, mun, I'm telling you...
There's something in the air... Something which reminds me of flipping great horrible monsters.
D'you reckon this might be one of them rift things that Conductor was banging on about? Must be, mustn't it...
So what're we going to do, Ollie-boy?
Uh-oh... It's another one of them flipping rift things!<NL>I don't like it, mun... Not one bit.
What's the betting there's a proper massive monster lurking round by here, then, eh? And what are we going to do about it if there is?
Careful, Ollie-boy! I can sense something proper nasty. Feel it in my lantern, I can...
Right, let's play it safe, mun. But I've got a feeling we can't just leave this blighter here forever...
Examine the black orb?
This pile of nuts and bolts en't budging an inch. Do you reckon the heat got to it?
Come on, Ollie-boy! No sense trying to make friends with scrappy here. Let's get going!
This is one of them robots that attacked us in the Ivory Tower. The heat must've got to it.
Knickers! It's a flipping magimech!<NL>Look out, Ollie-boy!
Gaaarrrgh!
Tidy! Nice one, Ollie-boy! If any more magimechs fancy a scrap, you'll give 'em what for!
That's two of those buckets of bolts you've stuck on the scrap heap! Just two more to go!
That's three of those rust buckets you've stuck on the scrap heap! Just one more to go!
Tidy! Looks like you got them all, Ollie-boy! Now, let's get back to the Ivory Tower, shall we?
We're s'posed to be heading for Al Mamoon, en't it?
We'll never stop that volcano from erupting if we don't get a flipping move on!
We should get ouerselves up to the top of the mountain, en't it? See what's what up there...
Look up there at the top, mun! Smoking like billy-o, it is!
The monsters by here are much tougher than the ones over in the desert. What you want is familiars with water tricks up their sleeves.
Knickers, knickers, knickers! If we don't hurry up, all heck is going to break loose, mun!
Leg it, Ollie-boy! There's not a moment to lose!
The chests can wait till next time, mun! This a flipping emergency!
This is no time to be chatting, mun! Hop it!
There's all fire blowing out of the rocks, Ollie-boy! I'd give them a wide berth if I were you. But not too wide. And hurry up. But don't do anything reckless.
We've got to find out what the problem is before this flipping volcano blows its flipping top, mun!
I got a bad feeling about whatever's up the top there. A very bad feeling, right in my lantern...
Ignore what they say, mun—don't fight fire with fire, fight it with water! You got any familiars with water tricks? If you have, flipping well use them!
Reckon we've got a thing or two to be going and telling Rashaad, don't you?
Onward, to Castaway Cove!
We need to get after that dirty rotten thief, en't it?
Just going to let that stinking thief run off with the pot, are we?
Oi! Where are you off to, eh? The magic words for that pot are in the flipping Wizard's Companion, mun!
Come on, mun! Let's get down to Castaway Cove and set sail on the high seas!
We need to get that Cowlipha of Al Mamoon to let us borrow her boat, en't it?
Fancy taking a look at the Cat's Cradle they've got over in Al Mamoon? I hear it's a proper snazzy one.
Let's get over to youer world, shall we?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, en't there?
Shift it, mun! Let's get back to Al Mamoon!
We need to head over to Al Mamoon and find us some restraint, mun!
Don't you like Al Mamoon or something?<NL>We need to head back there, mun!
Let's go and give old Cowface her restraint back, shall we?
If we head down to Castaway Cove, we should be able to ride that boat now, en't it?
Oi! We need to get back to Castaway Cove and retrieve ouer stolen goods!
Come on, mun! We need to go down to Castaway Cove and find us some restraint!
Let's go and hand over that restraint we got ouerselves, shall we?
That boat's going to leave without us if we don't get a flipping move on! Castaway Cove, and don't spare the ulks!
All aboard! Let's go and hit the high seas, en't it!
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
...Eh?<NL>Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.
We need to go and give those boys their pieces of art back, en't it.
S'pose we'd better go and make my mam laugh, eh?
Come on, mun! We need to get inside my mam, en't it?
We've got some unfinished business back inside my mam, mun!
We need to go and help those littlies!<NL>Pronto!
Come on, there's a slide in my mam's tum just waiting for us to go down it!
It's off to see the Empire, the wonderful Empire of Hamelin! In Autumnia!
Let's hurry up and get ouerselves to Hamelin, shall we?
D'you see any sages round by here?<NL>I flipping don't!
Reckon youer going to get some Hamelin armor round by here, do you? Well I flipping don't!
Oi, what do you think youer doing, ditching youer piggy armor and running off?
What exactly does this have to do with sneaking ouer way into the palace in Hamelin, hm?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?
We going back to the palace in Hamelin, or what, mun?
Let's get some belief off that Marcassin, shall we?
Come on, mun! Let's give Marcassin his belief back!
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
Itching to get over to Kublai's hideout, I am!
We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?
Let's hurry up and find that dragon's soul mate, shall we?
Motorville, mun! And make it snappy!
I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface? He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
Let's find that last stone shall we, mun?
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!
What do you reckon's going on with that soldier from Xanadu over in front of the palace in Hamelin, eh?
Time to take a trip on old Tengri, I reckon!
Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!

Flowers? In a place like this? Those are some hardy flipping perennials, Ollie-boy!
Is it daytime or nighttime? I can't flipping tell, it's so dark round by here, mun!
There's probably one of them hot spring thingies round by here somewhere, mun. Fancy stopping for a quick dip?
Earthquakes, thunderstorms and fires, all rolled into one! There's hospitable! What a flipping place, mun...
Youer not asking me for help again, are you!?
What's up with you, eh?

There's something written on the wall by here, mun!
"<color:#1>Two firm friends play leapfrog, all across the floor...</color>"
Erm... Oh! There's more!
"<color:#1>Each one gamely going where the other was before.</color>"
Doesn't make much sense to me, mun...
There is something written on the wall:
"Two firm friends play leapfrog, all across the floor,<NL>Each one gamely going where the other was before."
CRIKEY! H-H-Humans!
Don't be scared!<NL>You're one of the fairies from Golden Grove, right?<NL>
We've come to tell you that it's safe for you to go back to the forest!
R-Really? Like, serious?
That's right, mun. Time for you to head home to youer butties, en't it?
Oh... Ohhh flipping heck, mun!<NL>This is the best news ever!
I just ran from the forest as fast as I could, see...<NL>And I thought this would be a good place to hide...<NL>But then I got trapped in here, didn't I!?
I thought I was a total goner, like.<NL>That's why I'm so blinking... (sniff) ...chuffed!<NL>Sorry, mun. (sob) This is all getting too much...
Uh... It's nothing, really...<NL>There's no need to cry...
Flipping heck, Bunting, this one's worse than you!<NL>He's going to get ribbed something rotten when he gets back to the forest! Hee hee!

Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
I should have flipping known, mun.<NL>Another rift...
It's probably why the monsters round by here have been so vicious, en't it?
Shall we have a closer look, Ollie-boy?
Watch youerself, Ollie-boy!<NL>I got a funny feeling in my lantern about this one!
This thing's only going to get worse if we ignore it,<NL>Ollie-boy...
Examine the black orb?
......
Thank you for coming, Oliver.<NL>Shall we continue our tale?
I said I would tell you of how the three Keepers were driven from the kingdom. How they became evil...
Below the King, at the head of the Nazcaän government, sat the Council of Twelve, a group of lords known as the "Zodiarchs."
They were responsible for the day-to-day running of the kingdom, and were supposed to be the ruler's closest advisors.
But the Wizard King's rise to prominence was a source of consternation for the Council, who feared his great power and the loyalty he commanded amongst the Keepers.
And so, as soon as Nazcaä was rebuilt, and stability restored, the Zodiarchs conspired to assassinate him. And their conspiracy was a success...
Th-That's...horrible...
With the Wizard King eliminated, the Council had complete control of the kingdom. The King's infant heir, Queen Cassiopeia, became no more than a puppet.
To compound their villainy, the Council successfully implicated the Keepers in the assassination, and they were banished from Nazcaä...
Aapep lost all faith in humanity, and soon the power of the stone in his possession began to corrupt him, transforming him at last into a servant of evil...
Indeed, it was he who reduced this once great city to the ruins you see before you now.
That's bad, like, but you've got to feel sorry for him, en't it? Being framed for murdering youer mate would be enough to make anyone go off the rails.
Perhaps... But Aapep possessed great wisdom. None could have predicted that he would suffer such a spectacular fall from grace...
Speaking of predictions... Yes.<NL>Open the book.
Uh... You mean the Wizard's Companion?
I do. As you may or may not know, its authors were able to see into the future.
Turn to the final page. A prophecy is written there. A prophecy of what would become of a certain individual. That person's name, too, is hidden there.
Can you discover their identity?
This puzzle is much like life: you must start at the bottom, and work your way to the top—not forgetting to begin at the beginning, of course.
The solution is not a simple one, but a worthy wizard will see to the heart of the problem.
Do you have the answer, Oliver?
As I told you, this puzzle is much like life: you must start at the bottom, and work your way to the top—not forgetting to begin at the beginning.
You need not read too much into what is written on the page. In fact, you can ignore almost every letter of it...
That is correct.
Perhaps one day the people of this world will see that the White Witch had nothing but the best of intentions...
But first, she must make amends for what she did.<NL>Despair is no excuse...
I guess you're right...
I remember when she was a kind little girl who loved flowers above all else...
...But that is a story for another time. If you are interested, I plan to visit a cave that lets one see into the past...
I wish to see the old Cassiopeia once more...
There's a cave that lets you see into the past?
You have not heard of it? I am certain that it is mentioned in that book of yours...
When you have discovered its location, come and gaze into the past with me.
Until then, Oliver...
Rarebit, rarebit! Rarebit...<NL>(One of them stones must be hiding somewhere in the depths of this place, mun! Fingers crossed...)
Rarebit... Rarebit...<NL>(This place gives me the willies, mun. Feels like there's something...lurking down by here somewhere.)

Rarebit... Rarebit!<NL>(That room before that door proper gives me the creeps, mun!)
Rarebit...? Rarebit!<NL>(How do we get to the end of these ruins, mun? I don't know whether I'm flipping coming or going!)
Rarebit, rarebit?<NL>(Sounds like we just set off some<NL>kind of mechanism, en't it?)
Raaarebit... Rarebit?<NL>(Those magic circle trap thingies on the floor are a right pain. Why not cast a spell and sail over them, Ollie-boy?)
Rarebit, rarebit!<NL>(That riddle was proper clever, mun!)
Rarebit! Rarebit, rarebit!<NL>(No prizes for guessing why the<NL>serpent key's called the serpent key!)
Rarebit? Rarebit, rarebit...<NL>(Here we are at last, eh, Ollie-boy?<NL>You'd best get ready, my lad...)

Rarebit, rarebit? Rarebit, rarebit!<NL>(You got everything, Ollie-boy? Then let's get out of here!)
Rarebit! Rarebit!<NL>(Let's get out there and complete ouer magic stone collection!)
Rarebit! ...Rarebit?<NL>(There must be one of them stones down in the depths of this place somewhere, mun. ...Mustn't there?)
Rarebit, rarebit? Rarebit...<NL>(You don't reckon he'll pounce on us the moment we open the door, do you? Nah, mun. Ignore me. )

So if we beat this Aapep character, the prince's curse will be lifted, is it? And I bet he's got the stone we're after, and all. Tidy! Two birds with one, er...magic stone!
That room before that door proper gives me the creeps, mun!
How do we get to the end of these ruins, mun? I don't know whether I'm flipping coming or going!
Sounds like we just set off some kind of mechanism, en't it?
Those magic circle trap thingies on the floor are a right pain. You should cast a spell and sail on over the top of them, Ollie-boy.
So the riddle meant we had to swap them statues round, did it? Who'd have thunk it, eh? There's clever!
Well, there's no prizes for guessing why the serpent key's called the serpent key!
Here we are at last, eh, Ollie-boy? You'd best get ready, my lad. Things could get hairy.
Here goes then, eh? Ohh, but I hate flipping snakes, mun, I really flipping do...
Well, there's no stones left by here now, mun. Cleaned out, the place is!
The prince is back to his old self! And all thanks to the power of love! There's beautiful!
You got everything, Ollie-boy? Then let's get out of here! I've had enough of this place to last me a flipping lifetime!
Let's get out there and complete ouer magic stone collection, shall we, Ollie-boy?
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!
What do you reckon's going on with that soldier from Xanadu over in front of the palace in Hamelin, eh?
Time to take a trip on old Tengri, I reckon!
Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now 'til the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea to, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
No wonder they call it the Vault of Tears. Looks like someone's cried up a tidy little flood, it does. There's miserable!
I smell traps, mun. Keep youer eyes peeled, or youer in for trouble!
There's something proper tragic about this place, mun. And I'm not talking about the decor...
Snakes? I hate flipping snakes! And frogs? I hate them even flipping more! Horrible, slimy, hoppy things! Eurgh...
The roof en't about to collapse on ouer heads, is it? And here I am without an umbrella!
Wahey!
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
Let's start the new day as we mean to go on, shall we? Best foot forward, and last one in's a rotten egg!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
Lay off for a bit, will you? Even us fairies need a bit of time to ouerselves now and again...
You should have a read of youer Wizard's Companion once in a while, mun. It's the wizardly thing to do.
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.

Looks like that bridge's seen better days!<NL>Right, Ollie-boy! Crack out youer wand!<NL>You know the drill!
Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
Oh, knickers! It's one of them rift thingies...<NL>Just what we flipping need...
I'll bet that there is why it's gone all weird round by here.
Well, we'd best bite the bullet and sort it out, en't it? Sooner we do, the sooner we can get out of this<NL>flipping place.
Be careful, Ollie-boy! I've got a bad feeling, right in my lantern...
Fair enough, mun. But I don't reckon this problem's going to go away on its own. Just saying, like...
Examine the black orb?
...
Thank you for coming, Oliver.
This valley changed so much. It was once a place of beauty, awash with flowers of every color...
No matter. What is done is done.<NL>Now, let me continue my tale...
The Wizard King ascended the throne and won great renown as a just ruler, treating all his subjects equally, be they human or otherwise.
They, in turn, repaid him by rallying round their new monarch, and together they rebuilt the ruined realm more swiftly than any had thought possible.
So he got all the beasties pulling their weight too, did he? I never knew that, mun! Nice!
Indeed. The Wizard King truly was a man like no other...
It was then, with the kingdom all but rebuilt, that he chose three servants from among his subjects...
A swashbuckling sea captain to represent the race of men, a great wolf to represent the animals, and a serpent lord to represent the creatures.
Each was wholly devoted to his master, and did all that the Wizard King asked.
But of the three, the serpent lord was the wisest, and the most committed to his master's cause.
He was known as "The King of Cobras"—and what a mind he had. Ah, to think of how he was then...
This seems as good a time as any for your next question...
You have encountered these three servants on your travels, but can you recall the name of the mighty snake you faced?
I am sure listening to me will have served to jog your memory. Speak to me again when you have your answer.
Do you have the answer, Oliver?
Ah, the King of Cobras... To think of how he was then...
That is correct.
Though the three servants achieved so much, their reward was to be chased without dignity from the kingdom they had helped to build...
But perhaps that is a tale for another day...
...Yes. We will continue our tale in the very ruins where you faced Aapep.
I will tell you of how the Wizard King's three most loyal servants were driven to the path of evil.
Until then, Oliver...
Flipping heck. This robot's taken a proper battering. Hey...you don't reckon robots have gh-ghosts, do you?
Well, if we don't go touching it, we won't get any robot spirits clanking after us. Come on, Ollie-boy! On we go!
This is one of those robots we saw in the White Witch's palace, en't it? What's it doing in a flipping graveyard?
Knickers! It's a flipping magimech!<NL>Look out, Ollie-boy!
Gaaarrrgh!
Tidy! Nice one, Ollie-boy! If any more magimechs fancy a scrap, you'll give 'em what for!
That's two of those buckets of bolts you've stuck on the scrap heap! Just two more to go!
That's three of those rust buckets you've stuck on the scrap heap! Just one more to go!
Tidy! Looks like you got them all, Ollie-boy! Now, let's get back to the Ivory Tower, shall we?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
I've got a nasty feeling about this place. Cursed, it is, or I'm not the funniest fairy who ever walked the land...
Off on the road with these two again, is it? Well, as long as they behave themselves. Any messing around, though, and it'll be straight to bed with no dinner...
I can't believe I never noticed those two following us! Crikey, mun, I must be losing it or something...
Pretending to be dead, is it? Youer a wizard, mun, there must be a spell for this sort of thing.
Don't go actually killing youerself, will you, Ollie-boy? I don't want you firing fireballs in youer face or nothing...
Hurry up and make that skellington think youer dead, en't it?
Did you like my dead fairy act? Proper in character, I was. Stopped breathing and everything! That's the difference between nomination and award, that is, mun.
That was a fine performance, mun! Award-worthy, In fact! Ha! I never thought I'd enjoy corpsing!
A casino, is it? But it'll take years to build one of those, mun! Hang on—we're going back to the future soon! Tidy!
Was it just me, or was there a sort of...supernatural chill in that little hut we stopped at? Just me, is it? Fine, never mind!
Did you see a little girl's face in the window of that hut? No? Must've been a trick of the light or something...
Something's up with Swaine and that lot, mun. Did something happen while I was asleep?
Crikey, that was a close-run thing, eh? If that Marcassin hadn't stepped in, we'd've been toast!
Righto, that's the guardian beaten—let's get under that altar thingy and see what's down there, shall we? Tidy!
Let's go and claim ouer prize, shall we? Tidy!
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?
We going back to the palace in Hamelin, or what, mun?
Let's get some belief off that Marcassin, shall we?
Come on, mun! Let's give Marcassin his belief back!
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
Itching to get over to Kublai's hideout, I am!
We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?
Let's hurry up and find that dragon's soul mate, shall we?
Motorville, mun! And make it snappy!
I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface? He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
Let's find that last stone shall we, mun?

Aaah! Look! That tree's moving all by itself! Nah, mun! It en't the wind—there en't any! Ooh, there's creepy!
This place used to be a town full of wizards. If you look carefully at the tombstones... Boo! Sorry, mun. Not funny. Not for you, anyway...
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!

Hello to you! Here in the Glittering Grotto, there are being the hidden pathways.
There are walls that are looking strange, yes?<NL>If you are looking at the one beside me... Huh!?
But what is this? There is no hidden pathway behind<NL>this wall?
Hm. Even if you are going down below, there is no way through. The path is having been destroyed by someone, it is looking like...
Still you are wanting to go ahead, yes? If you are insisting. Head straight through there. Keep going forward, yes?
This ice is blocking ouer way, Ollie-boy.<NL>Got any spells that might do the trick?
Look up there, mun! That's an icicle and a half, that is! I bet a little nudge would send it tumbling straight down. There's scary.
Look at that massive great icicle! I reckon it'd only need a little nudge to bring it crashing down...
Ollie-boy, take a look up there! Do you reckon we could use that flipping great icicle?
Now the flipping thing's fallen down, it's in the flipping way! We'd best melt it eh, Ollie-boy?
Knickers! Get a load of that, Ollie-boy!
That pooer dab of a tomte is in a proper spot of bother!
You're right! We've got to help him!
Time to send that beastie packing!<NL>All set, Ollie-boy?
That's the spirit! Let's give him a proper battering!
For crying out loud, mun! Where's youer fighting spirit? We have to help that pooer furball!
Will you try to drive the monster away?
Yah! That is being very frightening!
Jeepers... That was close. I sure am glad you're okay and everything...but you really shouldn't have come here on your own.
Too flipping right! Didn't youer mother tell you not to go wandering around the place?
I am being very, very sorry. Please forgive me.
Well, you're safe now. That's the main thing. Let's head back to Yule. Everybody's real worried about you.
Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
Not another ruddy rift!<NL>What the heck is going on!?
Had it up to here with these flipping things, I have, mun! Doing my head in, they are!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Don't hang about! Sort this thing out, will you?
Careful now, Ollie-boy! I got that feeling I get in my lantern when something proper nasty's coming!
Fair dos. But you know we'll only have to come back later, en't it?
Examine the black orb?
......
I have been waiting for you, Oliver.<NL>Shall we continue our tale?
Flowers always held a special significance for the people of the kingdom of Nazcaä. They were seen as sacred symbols of peace and hope.
Queen Cassiopeia loved nothing in the world more than flowers, and her every free moment was spent tending to her garden.
Her castle was always bursting with color, with beautiful, bright flowers of every imaginable hue.
Cassiopeia grew to be a splendid, spirited young woman—everything her father could have wished for, and all that I had always hoped she would become.
Huh? So you knew Queen Cassiopeia when she was growing up?
I did. I knew her from when she was a mere babe in arms...
...But I digress. This talk of flowers and gardens...it reminds me. You have a wand made from an old stick, do you not?
Oh, you mean the wand Pea gave me?
That wand was a gift from the Wizard King and I to the young Cassiopeia.
It was? Jeepers...
On it, we engraved our most deeply held wish for the princess's future... Ahh, it was so long ago...
I wish to hear those words again.<NL>Tell me, Oliver—what does it say?
Do you have the answer, Oliver?
The symbols carved into the wand are of the Nazcaän script. Use your Wizard's Companion to decipher them.
That is correct.
Our most deeply held desire was that the people of Nazcaä should never lose hope. The hope of a brighter tomorrow...
But what befell the realm after the Wizard King's untimely demise put paid to any such wishes...
The Council of Twelve devoted themselves solely to personal gain, and thought nothing of the plight of<NL>the people.
If only... If only I had done more...
What do you mean, Horace?
I said that I would tell you the truth, did I not?
There is something I must confess to you. Something I did. An act for which I can never forgive myself...
Come to the Ivory Tower, to the chamber where the Council sat. There, I shall tell you everything.
Until then, Oliver...
This is like that rust bucket we saw on the Tombstone Trail, en't it? What the flipping heck are they?
It looks like its cogs are all frozen up, but I wouldn't want to be around when it thaws. Let's get going, Ollie-boy!
This robot's frozen solid, so it won't be chasing us around the place. Not like those ruddy robots back in the Ivory Tower.
Look, mun! It's a magimech!<NL>Get youer wand ready, Ollie-boy!
Gaaarrrgh!
Tidy! Nice one, Ollie-boy! If any more magimechs fancy a scrap, you'll give 'em what for!
That's two of those buckets of bolts you've stuck on the scrap heap! Just two more to go!
That's three of those rust buckets you've stuck on the scrap heap! Just one more to go!
Tidy! Looks like you got them all, Ollie-boy! Now, let's get back to the Ivory Tower, shall we?
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?

Ollie-boy! Did you see that tomte? No? Never mind...
What with all the icicles and big walls of ice and everything, it's proper hard going round by here, eh? You got a spell to make it easier, mun?
This place is crawling with nasty beasties, en't it? Proper infested, it is!
Ollie-boy! Did you see that tomte? What the heck is he doing, mun?
I could've told you that ice column thingy was going to break, mun! You scared the flipping life out of me when you jumped on it!
Did you see that ice wall back there? Shimmering in a funny way, it was. Or maybe I'm just seeing things...
Well, there's no stones left by here now, mun. Cleaned out, the place is!
Let's get out there and complete ouer magic stone collection, shall we, Ollie-boy?
You got everything, Ollie-boy? Then let's get out of here! I've had enough of this place to last me a flipping lifetime!

All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
F-F-F-F-Flip, it's cold! My nose is lovely and warm, though. Maybe this lantern does have its uses, after all...
S-S-S-S-Stew! A steaming-hot p-p-pot of s-s-stew...with my feet in it! Ahh, that'd sort my chilblains out good and proper.
Have you noticed? The wind blows into the deepest part of the cave. There's something back there, mun. You mark my words!
So we're in the Mountain King's mouth, is it? Well, at least he doesn't have bad breath. Not like some I could mention...
I look proper sharp in this cold weather gear, en't it? What am I saying, mun? I look proper sharp in flipping everything!
You sure youer familiars en't getting peckish, Ollie-boy? Best have a check, en't it?
You know, when all this is over, I'm going to miss—erm... Misbehave, mun! Go crazy, I will. Fairy rarebit for breakfast, babana flans all day long...
No rush, Ollie-boy. Let's take it easy for a bit.
Youer not... Ha ha! You are, en't it?<NL>Youer flipping lost! Nice one, Cyril!
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
Fancy a race, Ollie-boy?<NL>I'm faster than I look, en't it!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper wound up, I am!<NL>Come on, let's do something, before I go potty!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
What's up with you, eh?
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!

Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
I bet you you-know-who will be lurking by here!<NL>I can see this coming a blooming mile off!
Maybe. But we can't just run away...can we?
Look out, Ollie-boy!<NL>Here he comes!
Hm. Are you sure this is a good idea, Ollie-boy?<NL>You might regret it in the long run.
Examine the black orb?
Ah, Oliver! We meet again!
What's that you say? You're wondering why this lake hasn't returned to normal? Why, this isn't the same lake<NL>at all!
And nor is the castle that lies beyond it!
You look puzzled, and maybe a little befuddled...and more than a bit bemused! Well, I recommend that you take a look for yourself...
What do you think? This lake is rather magnificent, wouldn't you agree?
So we can cross the Miasma Marshes now, en't it?
So Esther can play the Clarion too, is it?<NL>She's a proper musical talent, that one!
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh, Ollie-boy? You ready? You'd better flipping well be!
Crikey, souls floating about the place, rain falling everywhere... This place is a right old mess...
Watch out for those poison traps, Ollie-boy, they're a right pain in the flipping backside!
Th-That tree! It just moved! D-Did you see that!?<NL>This place is all wrong, mun. All wrong...
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea to, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
Crikey! Are those people's souls floating around in the air? Don't touch any, will you, Ollie-boy? You don't know where they've been...
Don't touch the water, mun! It's poisonous! Proper filthy, it is!
Do you get the funny feeling we're being watched, Ollie-boy? I flipping do...
Proper easy to get lost round by here, en't it? Keep an eye on youer map, eh. And another one over youer shoulder...
You did bring some poison-be-gone, didn't you? Well, don't come crying to me if you didn't, Bunting!
Youer not asking me for help again, are you!?
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
Wahey!
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
Lay off for a bit, will you? Even us fairies need a bit of time to ouerselves now and again...
No rush, Ollie-boy. Let's take it easy for a bit.
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
Youer not... Ha ha! You are, en't it?<NL>Youer flipping lost! Nice one, Cyril!

Knickers! Another one!?<NL>That makes fourteen by my count. Four-flipping-teen!
The Miasma Marshes and Nevermore are back to their horrible old selves and all... What the heck's going on?
I don't know. But what I do know is that we can't run away from this.
Look out, Ollie-boy!
Hang on, didn't you literally just say we couldn't run away from this? Make youer flipping mind up, will you!
Examine the black orb?
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!
What do you reckon's going on with that soldier from Xanadu over in front of the palace in Hamelin, eh?
Time to take a trip on old Tengri, I reckon!
Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
So Alicia was youer mam after all...<NL>Well I never...
Look at youer face, Ollie-boy! Glowing, you are!
That Mornstar packs a serious punch, eh? Tidy!
Well, here we are at last, Ollie-boy.
Nevermore... At long last... Crikey, it feels like a flipping age since we started out on this journey. Not that it hasn't been a magical experience, of course...
So this is Nevermore, is it?<NL>There's sinister...
Sounds like we just set off some kind of mechanism, en't it?
So touching them crystal thingies makes stairs appear, is it? What kind of a flipping system is that!?
It's quiet, mun. Too flipping quiet. Watch youer step, Ollie-boy...
Stop staggering about all over the place, mun! Youer making me seasick!
Looks like there's still a tidy way to go yet, Ollie-boy. Sure you wouldn't rather turn back?
Don't be a hero, Ollie-boy—there's no shame in casting Vacate if the going gets tough.
Look at my little boy Bunting! Who'd have thought you'd grow up to be this big and strong, eh? There's marvelous!
Youer the Pure-Hearted One, Ollie-boy.<NL>I knew it the moment I first laid eyes on you.<NL>Crikey, I'm good!
Flipping heck, mun! There's some serious magical power round by here somewhere. I can feel it in my lantern...
Think about all we've been through, mun...<NL>You can beat him, Ollie-boy. I know you can.
Listen, I'm only telling you this because we've made it so far, right? The thing is is...Smiley 'n' Surly never sent me any useful information. ...The pair of idiots.
Don't worry, Ollie-boy—Esther, Swaine, and of course youers truly—we're all right behind you!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?

Ah—! Oh—! Ngggh! Crikey, my guts...!<NL>Sorry, Ollie-boy, can you give me a moment?<NL>You might want to stand upwind of me, too...
Onward and upward, Ollie-boy! And then onward a bit more, and upward a bit more, and so on, and so on, for flipping ever...
Ooh, it's proper scary this place, eh?<NL>Even scarier than Mam's laundry basket!<NL>And that's proper scary, take it from me...
Why d'you reckon it's called "Nevermore"? I reckon it's because there's never been anywhere more dreary. Proper miserable, it is...
Blimey. Here at last, eh? Who'd have thought me and little boy Bunting would ever make it this far... Well, I did, obviously. Ahem.
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
Youer not... Ha ha! You are, en't it?<NL>Youer flipping lost! Nice one, Cyril!
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!

Want me to say something, do you? Sorry, mun, I got nothing for you. Not a sausage. Nada. Diddly-squat. Zero. Er...zilch.
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!

That aroma!? Surely not...<NL>Could it be...a <color:#1>lunch basket</color> prepared by my darling wife?
Looks like we've found that lady's husband, Ollie-boy!
Your wife asked us to bring you this lunch basket, Sir.
What blessed relief! Verily, I thought I was about to expire from hunger!
Now, may I trouble you with a request of my own, young one? Would you be so good as to deliver a message to<NL>my beloved?
Sure, I'd be happy to!
Wonderful. My message is simple:<NL>"When we are apart, it is winter in my heart, but how much more sweet seems reunion's heat!"
Crikey! This one's a proper poet! Come on, Ollie-boy, let's get that message to his missus before we forget how it goes!
Neato! Al Mamoon here we come!
I have asked my beloved wife for her understanding. She knows that I will return home the very moment I have gathered a sufficient quantity of mushrooms.
My beloved's lunch baskets are simply without equal. Yet cookery is only one of her multitude of gifts.
Erm... Is it just me, or are the monsters by here looking a bit...lively?
Huh? Why? What's going on?
Aha! I know, mun! They've sniffed that lunch basket, en't they? Proper whetted their appetite, it has.
Oh, jeepers!<NL>Then I guess we'd better be real careful...
Whaaat!?<NL>But the forest's just been sorted, mun!
Whaaat!?<NL>How's that, then? Eh? How's that?
Calm down, mun, will you?
Whaaat!? Drippy-boy? Is that you?<NL>When did you come back by here, then?
Just now, mun.<NL>Ollie-boy here lifted the curse Shadar put on me, en't it?
Whaaat!? This little human by here?<NL>What is it humans say again?<NL>Looks can be deceiving, is it?
Anyway, Drippy-boy, I'm glad youer here.<NL>Need youer help, I do.
Why? What have you done now?
I en't done nothing, mun!<NL>It's the forest, en't it!? Being terrorized, it is!
It en't been peaceful five minutes, and now these blinking <color:#1>hyperboars</color> have come along, pinching all ouer flipping mushrooms!
But there are heaps of mushrooms in Golden Grove.<NL>I'm sure you could let them have some...
Whaaat!? No way, mun! Those monsters have got an insatiable appetite! They'll eat every fungus in the forest if we don't stop them!
Mmm. Sounds like a proper pickle, that does.<NL>What do you reckon, Ollie-boy? Shall we go and sort them out?
All right! We'll get rid of those monsters somehow!
Whaaat!? Tidy!<NL>Erm... You do know they're proper nasty, don't you?
Don't worry, mun! Ollie-boy'll be fine. He'll have the Lord High Lord of the Fairies with him, won't he?
Drippy, mun! Youer helluva brave. Ta, boy bach!
Now, I heard there's <color:#1>three</color> of those <color:#1>hyperboars</color> altogether. We're counting on you, en't it?
Give over, Ollie-boy! Golden Grove'll go to the dogs if those pigs have their way! And youer just going to stand there and tell me you don't care!?
Drippy-boy, mun!<NL>I need youer help, I do.
I heard there's <color:#1>three</color> of those <color:#1>hyperboars</color> altogether. We're counting on you, en't it?
Whaaarrrgggh!<NL>This is it, mun! I'm a goner!
Drippy, mun! Help meeeeee!
A-Are you all right?
Just about, mun, just about.<NL>That monster was helluva frightening...
That was a full boar, see.<NL>Much tougher than the other monsters, they are.
Well, don't worry. They're all gone now.
Whaaat!? I don't believe it!<NL>Ta, boys! The forest is safe once more!
Take this, will you?<NL>It's a symbol of how grateful we all are, en't it?
Ta for keeping us safe, Drippy-boy.
I reckon them fairies who did a runner will be coming back before long, like.
I think that was the last one, Mr. Drippy.
Looks like youer right, Ollie-boy.<NL>Back to the fairies for a debriefing, then, is it?
Look, Mr. Drippy! It's another monster!
Oh, knickers!<NL>Pooer lad don't stand a chance, mun...
Come on, Ollie-boy! Let's get rid of that horrible beastie!
Squeah! (snort)<NL>Squeeeaaah! (snort)
Gnghhh!?<NL>Gnnnggghhh! (snort)
...Squeah?<NL>Squeeeaaahhh! (snort)
SQUEAH! (grunt)<NL>SQUEEEAAAH!!! (snort)
All the hyperboars have been defeated!<NL>Return to the Spring of Life and tell the fairy!
How do, Drippy-boy?<NL>Ta for youer help back then, like.
No need to thank me, mun.<NL>All in a day's work for the Lord High Lord, en't it?
Now, where are the other fairies?<NL>Still not come back, is it?
No, mun. No sign of them. They all went far away, see. They probably haven't heard that the forest is all<NL>peaceful again.
I worry about them, Drippy-boy, I really do...<NL>Us fairies en't cut out for life out there...
I know, mun! Why don't you go and tell them that the forest's back to normal? You'd do that for us,<NL>wouldn't you?
Whaaat!? Really!?<NL>Oh, ta! Ta, mun!
I want to help, honest I do, but your friends could be almost anywhere... Is there someplace you think we should look first?
No problem, mun! I've got a special way of knowing exactly where those pooer fairies have got to.
Now then, give me just a minute...
Hnnnghhh...!<NL>Haaa...hhhnnnggghhh!
(pant)<NL>I...I see something!
It's a flag, mun! A flag with a skull on it! That's where you should start youer search, near a <color:#1>red flag with a skull on it</color>.
Whoa! That's pretty neat!<NL>How come you can find out where your friends are?
Tee hee! Us fairies have special powers, en't it!?<NL>And that's just one of them!
All you need to do is think really, really hard about the person youer trying to find. Do that for a bit, and you'll see where they are!
Now, there's five fairies not come back yet, but I can only see where one of them is, like...
But that'll do for now, en't it!? Go and get this first one and bring him back to the forest. Ta, mun!
Wh-Whaaat!? <NL>That's blinking nasty, that is!
Hmm? Where are the other fairies?<NL>Still not come back, is it?
One of ouer missing fairies is near a <color:#1>red flag with a skull on it</color>. Please, mun, go and get him!
Whaaat!? It's been ages, mun!<NL>How do?
Top of the blinking world, en't I!?<NL>Can't you tell?
Ta, boys! You wouldn't believe how happy I am to have some company back by here at last!
You're welcome! I guess the other fairies still haven't come back, though, huh?
Do you think you could do that thing again and find out where they are, Sir?
My special fairy power, is it?<NL>All right then, here I goes...
Hnnnghhh...!<NL>Ahhh...oooh...hhhnnnggghhh!
<color:#1>Ruins filled with water</color>, mun!<NL>And...a <color:#1>cell</color>... A cell inside the ruins!
Ruins filled with water, is it?<NL>I'm sure I've seen somewhere just like that...
Well, never mind.<NL>Let's just start looking, shall we, Ollie-boy?
Yep! Let's go!
<color:#1>Ruins filled with water</color>, mun.<NL>That's what I saw, en't it? And inside of there, a <color:#1>cell</color>...
Hi again!<NL>We found another one of your friends!
Whaaat!? Tidy!<NL>How do, mun? I'm so blinking happy to see you!
How do, mun!? It's been ages, en't it!?<NL>Proper missed you, I have.
There's touching, Ollie-boy!<NL>They're both welling up, mun!
Right then, how's about we have a look for the other two, eh? We'll need a hint to put us on the right track,<NL>of course...
Leave it to me, Drippy-boy!
Hnnnghhh...!<NL>Ahhh... Ahhh...<NL>...Hhhnnnggghhh!
(pant) I...I see something! E-Erm...it looks like some kind of <color:#1>weird other world. One I've not seen before</color>, like.
Huh? Where could that be?
I saw these metal boxes, right, with humans in them! There were blinking loads of them, mun!
Well, they sound like—<NL>Oh! I think I know where we need to go!
Righto, Ollie-boy! Off we trot!
The next fairy's in some <color:#1>weird other world</color>, mun. <color:#1>One I've never seen before</color>, en't it...
Eh!? How come I'm back in the forest!?
Ah, magic, is it? Blinking handy things, wizards.<NL>Every home should have one, I reckon.
Whaaat!? You made it back from that weird other world!?
Thought we'd lost you for good, I did, what with youer pooer sense of direction and all...
Drippy-boy here sorted me out, didn't he?<NL>I couldn't have made it back without him, like.
Ta, Drippy. Helluva grateful, I am.
No need to thank me, mun!
I can't just leave another fairy stranded in some weird world full of humans, is it!?
Uh...okay. I guess we'd better start looking for that other fairy, huh?
Tidy! Just give me a minute....
...Hnnnghhh!<NL>Haaa... Hyurk! Oooh...<NL>Hhhnnnggghhh...AHHH!
(pant)<NL>I...I see something!<NL>A <color:#1>narrow little cave</color>, it is...
Hold on, mun! There's more... There's some <color:#1>tracks inside it</color> and all... And a human... <color:#1>A very pale human</color>...
A narrow cave with some tracks, is it?<NL>Have we seen anywhere like that, Ollie-boy?
Hmm... I'm not sure.<NL>Let's just see what we can find, Mr. Drippy!
The fourth fairy's in a <color:#1>narrow little cave</color>, like. There are some <color:#1>tracks inside it</color>, too...
Hi again, Mr. Fairy!<NL>We found another one of your friends!
Whoa, mun! That sun's helluva bright, en't it?<NL>And the smell of the forest... I've missed it so much!
How do, mun! That's four fairies come back now en't it!? Just one more to go!
All right! Can we have the final clue, Sir?
No problem, mun. One final clue, coming right up!
Gnnnhhhggghhh! Hnnnghhh...!<NL>Kyahhhnnnggghhh!
The last fairy's in some sort of <color:#1>forest</color>, hanging around with some <color:#1>forest dwellers</color>, looks like. Looks flipping <color:#1>freezing</color> by there and all...
Forest dwellers, is it?<NL>Finding them will be a blooming nightmare...
Come on, Mr. Drippy! This is the last one.<NL>Let's follow the clue and start looking!
(pant) The last fairy's somewhere in the middle of a <color:#1>freezing forest</color>, hanging around with some<NL><color:#1>forest dwellers</color>...
Ooph... My head's spinning, boys. Been using the old special powers a bit too much, I reckon...
Hi again!<NL>We found the last missing fairy!
Whaaat!? You found them all!? Oh, ta mun! I owe you a couple of fairy rarebits for this and no mistake, en't it!?
I bet you're glad to have all your friends back!
It's all thanks to you and your pal by here, Drippy-boy!
Now, I've prepared a little something just to say thanks, en't it?
Go on, mun. Take it!
Oh, and take these formulas while youer at it.
They should help you make some tidy weapons. Proper handy if ouer forest comes under attack some time...
Thanks again, boys. I can't begin to tell you how nice it is now everyone's back together, like.
We are the fairies of Golden Grove!<NL>The greatest fairies in the whole wide world!
I can't believe it, mun. Reunited at last.<NL>Ta, Drippy-boy!
Them ruins were proper horrible.<NL>Damp, they were, and dark...
Just the thought of it makes me well up, mun!
I'd love to go back to that other world sometime.<NL>Proper tidy, it was!
There en't nothing like a bit of sun!
Ah... It's nice and warm by here.<NL>I en't ever leaving Golden Grove again!
You learned some new formulae!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
What's going on here, eh?<NL>I've got a proper bad feeling about this...
Uh-oh! Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of something rum...
Is this something to do with the rifts that Conductor character was on about?
Knickers! What shall we do, Ollie-boy?
Look, Ollie-boy!<NL>It's one of them rifts!
I'm getting that bad feeling again, Ollie-boy.<NL>What do you reckon?
Up for it, are you? Well, don't say I didn't warn you...
Fair enough, mun. But I can't help feeling something proper bad might happen if we don't sort this out...
Examine the black orb?
Ollie-boy, mun! It's a blinking robot!<NL>Looks like it's been lying here a while, like...
Well, it's not going to help us get through this forest. Best to just leave it there for now, en't it.
It's one of them robots from the White Witch's palace! This one looks proper knackered, though...
Look, mun! It's a magimech!<NL>Get youer wand ready, Ollie-boy!
Bwaaahhh!
Tidy! Nice one, Ollie-boy! If any more magimechs fancy a scrap, you'll give 'em what for!
Good work, Ollie-boy!<NL>Two more to go—keep it up!
That's the third one down, mun!<NL>One to go—keep going!
That's it! That's all of them done!<NL>Let's head back to the White Witch's palace, en't it!
Southward we go, to Golden Grove!
Something's not right about the old Grove, mun. I can feel it in my lantern...
Come on, mun, let's push on through to Al Mamoon, shall we? Tidy!
Ahh, it's always a relief when you happen across a waystone, eh? Reassuring, they are. Like my mam's boiled squidcakes. Mmm...
See? There's nothing to the old mushroom-hopping lark, mun! It's as easy as not falling off a log!
Youer not s'posed to eat those massive mushrooms. No idea why, though... Here, shall we try one? ...No? Bah, suit youerself.
The way out of this place must be right at the end, right? That's how these things normally work, en't it?
Ahh, takes me back, this does! I've not seen a familiar egg in...oooh, donkey's years! Maybe more!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Let's restore that vine thingy to its former glory, shall we?
We can't just leave that familiar egg like that, can we, mun? We're not flipping heartless animals! ...Are we?
D'you reckon junior got the message? I wouldn't be surprised if he showed up again somewhere else, mun. Plucky little beggar...
Youer right, adventuring's no life for a youngster. He should do some frolicking and that first, eh? Enjoy his youth, like.
Don't dawdle, Ollie-boy!<NL>Get a flipping move on!
Crikey! I thought we were under attack, mun!<NL>Scared the life out of me, he did!
What's that over by there, mun?
Followed us, did he? There's faithful!<NL>Like a little green puppy-dog, he is!
You know you can't just carry equipment, en't it? I'm just saying—if you don't put it on, it won't flipping work!
The little 'un can put enemies to sleep. There's useful! You should give that a go one of these days, mun!
He looks like a fairy, en't it? There's awkward... Well, as long as he doesn't steal my material, I'm fine with it.
We did it! And it was all thanks to youers truly!<NL>...Well, you played youer part too, I s'pose, Ollie-boy...
Righto! Let's get that Spring of Life back to how it used to be, shall we?
Youer getting to be a pretty tidy fighter, Ollie-boy! I'd better stop calling you "Bunting," eh? Might live to regret it!
After Golden Grove, it's on to Al Mamoon!
En't we s'posed to be going and meeting that Rashaad bloke?
Come on, Ollie-boy! Let's get over to youer world!
Get a move on! We've got to help Rusty, en't it!?
En't you got something you need to tell Myrtle?
Let's get ouer bottoms in gear and get back to Al Mamoon, shall we?
Are you sure the Temple of Trials is this way?
What's wrong with you, mun?<NL>We need to go and see the Supreme Sage, en't it?
We're going nowhere fast until we pass those Trials, mun.
Come on, mun! Let's get down to the Temple and take that third Trial!
The Supreme Sage is waiting for us, en't he?
I know Solomon said to take a break, but that's no reason to go running off flipping miles away now, is it, mun?
We're s'posed to be heading for Al Mamoon, en't it?
We'll never stop that volcano from erupting if we don't get a flipping move on!
Reckon we've got a thing or two to be going and telling Rashaad, don't you?

There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, mun!
Shift it, mun! Let's get back to Al Mamoon!
We need to head over to Al Mamoon and find us some restraint, mun!
Don't you like Al Mamoon or something?<NL>We need to head back there, mun!
Let's go and give old Cowface her restraint back, shall we?
If we head down to Castaway Cove, we should be able to ride that boat now, en't it?
Oi! We need to get back to Castaway Cove and retrieve ouer stolen goods!

All aboard! Let's go and hit the high seas, en't it!
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
...Eh? Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.

S'pose we'd better go and make my mam laugh, eh?

You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!

We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?

I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface?<NL>He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
Let's find that last stone shall we, mun?
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!

Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
It's no wonder they call it holy wood, mun—have you seen it sparkle? There's beautiful!
What are we doing here? We lost the holy wood over by Ding Dong Dell, en't it?
The thief's got to be over by Ding Dong Dell somewhere, mun!

Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Here, we'd better go and check if Pip's any better hadn't we?
If we don't get that holy wood back, we're going nowhere fast, mun!
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
They're having a party down in Ding Dong Dell, mun! Let's get ouer glad rags on and boogie!
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä shall we, mun?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
Here, do you reckon you can eat them mushrooms over by there? I could murder a nice omelet, mun!
I know this place is famous for being fertile, but there's no harm in having a prune every now and again, is there? It's a right old mess!
You seen all them little yellow specks floating about the place? Making me sneeze like billy-o, they are!
Blimey, this treasure hunting's a right old faff, en't it? Can we stop for a rest, mun?
I always lose my way in this flipping place! Keep an eye on youer map, Ollie-boy—youer my only hope!
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!
Youer not... Ha ha! You are, en't it?<NL>Youer flipping lost! Nice one, Cyril!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper wound up, I am!<NL>Come on, let's do something, before I go potty!
You talking to me or chewing a brick? Sorry, mun. Just wanted to try and sound tough. Pretty convincing, eh?
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.

Idiots! Don't you know it's rude to speak to someone from behind? Why can't you be well-mannered? Like ME!
Ah, it's you. Missing me, were you?<NL>I bet you were!
What are you screwing your face up like that for? Have you got your hands on a <color:#1>familiar ticket</color> or something?
You can exchange them for <color:#1>super-mega-ultra-rare</color> familiars!
Ah, so you lot are here to compete in the Solosseum Series, are you?
Or have you by some miracle managed to get your hands on a <color:#1>familiar ticket</color>?
Hm? What's that? You don't have a ticket? Well, a fat lot of use you are!
If you manage to get your grubby mitts on one, come back and see me. Now go away.
...Eh? You don't have any room for another familiar, you idiot! Gah! Stop wasting my time!
Clear some space in your Creature Cage, then talk to me again—if you must.
What's that? You don't want to trade in your ticket? Well, you're no fun, are you?
Heh heh heh! I'm sure you and your new friend are going to get along famously! You don't mind being bitten, right?
You came.<NL>Umbopa has been waiting.<NL>Umbopa is tired of waiting.
But now it is time.<NL>It is time for the Solosseum Series!
Here only the strongest familiars fight.
The rules are simple.<NL>Umbopa will explain...
Fight familiars. If you win, fight some more. Then fight some more. Understand?
The Solosseum Series has six ranks.<NL>Rank E... Rank D... Rank C... Rank B... Rank A... Rank S... Six. Understand? Good.
Win any rank to get prizes. And money.
Did you hear the great big lump!? Money! Prizes! Is anyone else starting to get fired up about this?
I guess it does sound pretty exciting.
But do not forget: <color:#1>you cannot use items</color> in the Solosseum Series. Now, it is time to begin.
Let's give it our best shot!
You wish to enter the Solosseum Series?
Rank S is not ready. You have other things to do. Come back afterwards. Rank S should be ready then.
You wish to try another rank?
It is time...
Huh? Time for what?
It is time for the real tournament to begin.<NL>The ultimate challenge: Rank S.
Cor, the ultimate challenge, is it? I bet there's some proper bruisers waiting for us in there!
Yes. In Rank S, only the strongest compete.
But the prize is greater than all other ranks.
Are you ready? Do you have what it takes?
Please come back.
If you are injured, Umbopa will heal you.
Fight with all your might.
You have won Rank E. Well done.<NL>Here is your prize...
Perhaps you now want a sterner challenge? Well, you have earned your reward.
You have been defeated.<NL>Train more and return.
You have won Rank D. This is good.<NL>Here is your prize...
You have won Rank C. Yes. You grow stronger.<NL>Here is your prize...
You have won Rank B. Unexpected.<NL>Here is your prize...
You have won Rank A. Impressive.<NL>Here is your prize...
You have won again. Umbopa suspects Rank A does not challenge you... Well, here is your reward.
You have won Rank S. You now reign supreme in the Solosseum Series.
How about that then, Ollie-boy? We did it!<NL>We flipping well did it!
You said it, Mr. Drippy! We really did it!
A fine victory. Umbopa is impressed.<NL>You have grown strong.
My master will now recognize you as a true master in the field of familiars. You have passed the test.
...The test?
Yes. Umbopa did not mention...
The Solosseum Series is the final trial to be faced in this temple.
Only by passing this test can you earn the respect and recognition of my master.
The four Great Sages all passed this test.
...Really? Wow... Hearing that...I-I feel like we could take on anybody!
Flip, mun! You en't far off being a Great Sage youerself now! I reckon it'd suit you! Made for it, you were!
Hm! Enough talk.<NL>It is time to present you with your prize.
If you keep winning, poor Umbopa will run out of prizes. Well, here is your reward.
Rank S is not easy.<NL>Train more and return.
Good luck in the next rank.
Fight some more soon!
There is only one ticket like this in the world. You may exchange it for the precious mandragorer.
This creature's metamorphosis is...interesting. I wish you luck.
Do not delay. Take the ticket to my master.
Come again one day.
Pee-weeee!
...BOO! Heh heh heh!
Ba-doo-bee-doo-bah-BAH!<NL>Pa! Pa! Parp!
This cute creature is called a naiad. So there!
It's not very good at normal attacks, but it's got some decent magical ones, and it's a great healer, so it's helpful to have around.
You should definitely choose that one over the other two—they're rubbish!
This one's called a boggly-boo. It may have a stupid name, but it can scare the pants off people even worse than me!
It packs a hefty punch, and can learn some pretty nasty tricks, too! Heh heh heh!
That stupid-looking one's called a shonky-honker!
It's got good defense and magical attack, and it can put enemies to sleep, as well. It's a bit of an all-rounder,<NL>I suppose.
Knickers! This door en't budging.<NL>How d'you fancy retracing youer steps?<NL>Yeah, well, youer going to have to.
Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
There's something funny going on by here, mun, I'm telling you...
There's something in the air... Something which reminds me of flipping great horrible monsters.
D'you reckon this might be one of them rift things that Conductor was banging on about? Must be, mustn't it...
So what're we going to do, Ollie-boy?
Uh-oh... It's another one of those flipping rift things!
I never thought we'd find one by here, mun...<NL>How many of the rotten beggars are there!?
Careful, Ollie-boy! I can sense something proper nasty. Feel it in my lantern, I can...
Yeah, all right. Let's play it safe. We'd best remember where it is, though. So we can come back later, I mean...
Examine the black orb?
What kind of trials have they got at this temple, then?
Where was Rashaad sleeping, then?<NL>Not that I'm bothered or anything...
I slept like a flipping log, mun! Tidy!<NL>I must've been proper knackered...
Giving up, is it? Can't say I'm surprised.
What d'you reckon's beyond this door, then? Another door? Maybe a gate... Or a portcullis, even... Or maybe even a turnstile...
What was that spell he just used? Wasn't Spring Lock, was it? D'you think he'll teach us it? Best not push ouer luck, eh...?
That Solomon's got a right funny laugh on him, eh? And I don't mean in a good way...
I'd love to help you, Ollie-boy, but this is the Temple of Trials, not the Temple of Cheating So-and-Sos.
Go on, boy bach! Show those Trials who's boss! I'll be cheering you every step of the way, mun!
Giving you a bit of time to prepare, is he? Maybe the cheeky little beggar's not all bad...
Get to that waystone and save up a storm while you've got the chance, Ollie-boy!
Ahh, I'm so flipping proud of you, mun! Watching you sail through the Trials brought a tear to my eye!
Beasties with hearts above their heads? All sounds a bit unlikely to me, mun!
Which one you going for, then? Decisions, decisions, eh?
I don't like the look of that one on the left. Far too keen for its own good. Don't want it upstaging me, do I?
Those manhole covers lead to a secret network of tunnels that go all the way to the Familiar Retreat, or so I'm told. Proper elaborate, it is.
You can't use the Familiar Retreat yet, mun. You have to listen to what that Solomon's got to say for himself first.
Before you ask—no, you can't send me to the Familiar Retreat, so don't go getting any funny ideas! The flipping cheek...
We're s'posed to be heading for Al Mamoon, en't it?
We'll never stop that volcano from erupting if we don't get a flipping move on!
Reckon we've got a thing or two to be going and telling Rashaad, don't you?
Onward, to Castaway Cove!
We need to get after that dirty rotten thief, en't it?
Just going to let that stinking thief run off with the pot, are we?
Oi! Where are you off to, eh? The magic words for that pot are in the flipping Wizard's Companion, mun!

We need to get that Cowlipha of Al Mamoon to let us borrow her boat, en't it?
Fancy taking a look at the Cat's Cradle they've got over in Al Mamoon? I hear it's a proper snazzy one.
Let's get over to youer world, shall we?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, en't there?
Shift it, mun! Let's get back to Al Mamoon!
We need to head over to Al Mamoon and find us some restraint, mun!
Don't you like Al Mamoon or something?<NL>We need to head back there, mun!
Let's go and give old Cowface her restraint back, shall we?
If we head down to Castaway Cove, we should be able to ride that boat now, en't it?
Oi! We need to get back to Castaway Cove and retrieve ouer stolen goods!
Come on, mun! We need to go down to Castaway Cove and find us some restraint!
Let's go and hand over that restraint we got ouerselves, shall we?
That boat's going to leave without us if we don't get a flipping move on! Castaway Cove, and don't spare the ulks!
All aboard! Let's go and hit the high seas, en't it!
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
...Eh?<NL>Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.
We need to go and give those boys their pieces of art back, en't it.
S'pose we'd better go and make my mam laugh, eh?
Come on, mun! We need to get inside my mam, en't it?
We've got some unfinished business back inside my mam, mun!
We need to go and help those littlies!<NL>Pronto!
Come on, there's a slide in my mam's tum just waiting for us to go down it!

To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?

I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea to, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
Just look at the architecture! One of my favorite styles, too. There's tasteful! Don't look so surprised, mun—I'm proper cultured, me!
Why do they call it a temple, d'you reckon? There's not exactly much worshipping going on, is there? There's blasphemous...
You seen that face-shaped thingy? Reminds me of something, it does... Youer ugly mug, maybe? Ha! Only joking, Ollie-boy!
"The Supreme Sage," eh? Supreme compared to who, I wonder...
Trials, is it? I love a good trial, me! Come on, temple, hit us with youer best shot! We can take it! Grarrrgh! ...Sorry. Got a bit carried away.
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
You talking to me or chewing a brick? Sorry, mun. Just wanted to try and sound tough. Pretty convincing, eh?
Wahey!
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
Youer not asking me for help again, are you!?

Blimey! That was a flipping nasty surprise! Took years off my life, it did!
No one said anything about getting attacked by dirty great robots!
It sure was scary. But we saw robots like that before, didn't we?
That we did, mun. Saw them lying about all over the place, looking like they'd had their batteries taken out.
I never thought we'd find them up by here, though, and in full working flipping order.
Who knows? Maybe the rust buckets we've been seeing on ouer travels used to guard this place?
Gee, you could be right.
Well, whatever their game is, all I know is that they're a flipping menace.
Right. We'll be careful.
......
I have been waiting for you, Oliver.<NL>Shall we continue our tale?
Long before I ever became known as the Sage of Ages,<NL>I fought in the Wizard Wars alongside my teacher, the Wizard King.
I often think of those days... How long has it been since I was last here, I wonder?
Blimey, Horace! Youer saying you've been to this gaff before, like?
Indeed I have. In the years after the Wizard Wars, I occupied the tenth seat on the Council, taking the Zodiarchal title of "Gallus."
G-Gallus!? But isn't that—!? You know! ...Him!
Ah, yes. The Wizard King's ruse. Even in death, he strove to protect his daughter... That was later, of course, after my seat had become vacant.
But we are getting ahead of ourselves! ...When I sat on the Council, to my undying shame, I failed to notice the plotting of my fellow councillors.
Ah, I who thought myself so wise... They disposed of the Wizard King and his three servants, then turned their attention to any who might yet stand in their way.
And they considered me an obstacle to their complete domination of the kingdom.
Sensing the grave danger I was in, I fled Nazcaä. I intended to bide my time. To rally forces loyal to the crown, and return to exact my revenge on the Council...
But the choice I made was wrong. I should have remained at the Queen's side.
But you couldn't, could you? Those rotters in the Council were gunning for you, mun!
It is a risk that I should have taken. By leaving, I sealed the fate of the entire kingdom.
Allow me to explain. In addition to my duties as a Zodiarch, I had been charged with educating Queen Cassiopeia in the ways of magic.
I took it upon myself to create a compendium of spells and arcane knowledge which I presented to the young queen.
...A compendium? You mean like a...spellbook?<NL>...Y-You mean...!?
Ha ha! I rather think you know what I mean. But allow me to ask you the question—for old time's sake. What was the name of that book?
Hm hm! I rather think you know the answer, but I shall ask the question anyway—for old time's sake. What was the name of the book I gave to the young queen?
Yes, you are quite right.
I wrote the Wizard's Companion to aid Queen Cassiopeia in her magical education.
But little did I know that this book would lead directly to the disaster that befell Nazcaä.
You can't be flipping serious!? How could the Wizard's Companion have led to Nazcaä's destruction!? What the heck are you on about, mun!?
In my desire to create a tome fit for a queen, I included all manner of arcane magic...including the Forbidden Spell.
But I failed to include detailed notes on the rights and wrongs of using such potent incantations...
And I fled the kingdom before I could teach Queen Cassiopeia of the perils of the Forbidden Spell.
I was so busy brooding on what manner of revenge I would exact on the Council that I failed in my duty of care to the Queen.
That is how she arrived at her fateful decision... That is why she did not know the true power of Manna...
B-But...
It is my fault that Nazcaä fell, and that Queen Cassiopeia was transformed into the White Witch.
How could I ever make amends for what I did?<NL>It was...unforgivable.
Reduced to a spirit, doomed to roam the world for all eternity, how could I ever save that poor girl from her fate?
That is why I must humbly ask you to right my wrong—to save the Queen. You are the only one who can, Oliver.
...Don't worry, Horace. We'll save Queen Cassiopeia.<NL>We'll save the whole world, you'll see!
You have my thanks. And I have some alchemical formulae for you. Formulae that I neglected to include in the Wizard's Companion.
I pray that they will aid you on your quest.
And now for my final contribution to your cause.<NL>Please accept this...
I speak of the very book you are carrying, Oliver.<NL>Surely you know the answer?
Queen Cassiopeia waits within. I wish you luck, Oliver—the Pure-Hearted One... The Savior of our world...
It is good of you to join us here in the clouds.<NL>We have awaited your coming.
Huh? Y-You were waiting...for us?
Hmm... I still have my doubts.<NL>Can this boy really be the one we seek?
But you have seen the girl who accompanies him, have you not? She is the very image of the Queen in her youth.
If our Queen has led him here, then he must surely possess the power we require.
I would like nothing more than to believe you... But how can our Queen see clearly when she is enveloped in fathomless darkness?
Oi, Tinface! I don't care how fancy youer flipping armor is—didn't youer mam ever teach you it's rude to whisper in front of people!?
E-Excuse me, Sir, but...who are you?<NL>And, um...what are you doing here?
We once formed the Queen's honor guard.<NL>It was our duty to protect this palace.
Lest you wonder, we are illusions, given life by the power of the Queen's imagination, much like the Zodiarchs you have no doubt encountered.
You what!? Quick, Ollie-boy—get youer wand ready! We've got a fight on ouer hands!
Hm! This fairy is a feisty one, is he not? Fear not.<NL>We are not your enemies. The Zodiarchs who sat<NL>on the Queen's Council were malign...
But we sprang from that part of our Queen's heart that is still wise and just. Though Her Radiance has lost sight of this side of herself, it lives on.
Indeed, it was this very part of her heart that led you here, to us.
Now we wish you to grant rest to those who once defended our cursed kingdom.
Cursed kingdom?<NL>I guess you mean Nazcaä, huh?
Precisely. Now, would you be good enough to hear<NL>our request?
Well, ummm... Sure, I guess.<NL>What is it that you'd like us to do?
Long ago, before our Queen was born, war raged across this land.
No part of our world was spared the horror and turmoil of the Wizard Wars.
As each side vied for advantage, new weapons were devised which fused steel, stone, and sorcery.<NL>Weapons known as <color:#1>magimechs</color>.
Of course, the magimechs stationed around the palace are mere replicas. The originals were vastly more powerful.
When the war ended, these weapons were deprived of their purpose, and one by one, they became dormant—<NL>a state akin to eternal sleep.
Or so we believed. It now seems that some have reawoken.
In all, four magimechs have emerged from their slumber. Perhaps the reappearance of the Ivory Tower disturbed them. We are not certain.
In any case, these magical weapons are unwanted relics<NL>of that wretched conflict. They have no place here in<NL>this time.
We have faith that our Queen's heart will be restored to its former purity. And when this happens, we would spare her the sight of such tragic vestiges of Nazcaä's past.
This is why we ask that you help the magimechs return to their slumber.
Listen, helmetface! Are you sure youer telling us the<NL>full story? 'Cos I'm not sure I trust you as far as I<NL>could spit you!
All this business about the Queen's heart being pure... Well, it sounds nice enough—but I en't seen much evidence of it so far! Something smells fishy to me!
But Mr. Drippy, don't you remember those visions from Queen Cassiopeia's past?
Y-You saw them too, right?<NL>I just... I think they're telling the truth.
We appreciate your good faith, young man.
So where are they? The magimechs, I mean...
When peace returned after the Wizard Wars, the<NL>magimechs were confined to a number of secure<NL>locations around the world.
But over the centuries, many changes have been wrought on the landscape, and we can no longer be certain of<NL>their whereabouts.
Perhaps on your travels, you have laid eyes on these ancient weapons, sleeping peacefully?
I am afraid we can offer you little guidance.<NL>You must rely on your own memories.
Oh, that's brilliant, that is! Make it easy for us, why don't you? Flipping dodgy blooming tinfaced...
Calm down, Mr. Drippy!<NL>I'm sure if we think real hard, we can—
We have one piece of information which may prove<NL>useful to you—<color:#1>magimechs have a strong connection<NL>to memory stones</color>.
You are familiar with them, I take it? The monuments that grant healing, and store one's recollections. Wherever a memory stone is found, so, too, may a magimech reside.
Okay! We'll do it! We'll find them for you!
...I see. That is most unfortunate. I confess that I had begun to believe that you might be the one.
Our Queen led you here, which leads us to believe that you possess the power to come to our aid.
Will you do us the favor of hearing our request?
Magimechs have strong ties with what we call memory stones. Find the stones, and you may also find the ones you seek.
This is splendid! The magimechs have returned to their eternal slumber.
It seems that we underestimated your power. I sense that you may even be capable of facing the kingdom's other great defenders in battle.
You what!? Don't tell me there's more blooming robots that need battering!?
I am afraid there are—further remnants of the Sagely Stone Age. They guarded the main cities of Nazcaä throughout the Wizard Wars.
While the Ivory Tower has floated free of the world below, these guardians have remained in Nazcaä, watching over the kingdom...
We speak of the <color:#1>magimech masters</color>.
They were charged with guarding the kingdom's three great cities—Nazcaä, Tak'al, and Itzos.
Wow. I guess there's still a lot of places I've never heard of.
Nazcaä was the capital city, and its culture and language dominated the kingdom.
We were the Knights of Nazcaä, and defended the capital, alongside the magimech masters.
But now that the power sealing them has waned, these once stout defenders pose a great threat to the people of this world, yourselves not least of all.
We would ask that you grant them rest, as you did their lesser brethren.
Okay, we'll do what we can!
We thank you. Your courage and spirit are admirable.<NL>You will find the magimech masters where the three<NL>cities once stood.
But know that almost nothing now remains of those once bustling metropolises.
Nothing save <color:#1>faded glyphs upon the ground</color>...
So all we have to do is keep ouer eyes peeled for weird doodles on the floor, is it? Sounds like a doddle! Ready, Ollie-boy?
I sure am!
Now all that is left of the kingdom's three great cities are faded glyphs upon the ground.
Splendid work! I confess that we harbored certain doubts as to whether you could truly defeat such formidable opponents.
I assure you, the hearts of their masters are much lighter for your efforts.
..."Masters"? You mean the magimech masters had masters of their own?
Indeed. The magimechs were in truth formed from the fighting spirit that dwelled within the hearts of certain individuals... They were...familiars...
And each once had a human master...
...And three of those masters now stand before you.
Wh-What do you mean!?
Oh, heck... I think I see where this is going...
Yes! We Knights of Nazcaä, too, command soldiers of the soul! Come, prove your worth against the mightiest magimechs of all!
Show us your true power!
Extraordinary! To have beaten even our mighty familiars...
So, let me get this straight—all them robobruisers you had us going round bashing were flipping familiars all along?
Indeed they were.<NL>I feel we owe you an apology.
How come?<NL>Apart from for attacking us, I mean...
Those magimechs... Those weapons of stone and steel that we asked you to defeat... They posed threat to neither man nor beast.
You flipping what!? You mean them great big bags of bolts were harmless all along? Grrr... You, you, you flipping fibbers!
We are truly sorry. But had we told you the truth, you would almost certainly have refused.
Of course we would have! Why would you make us hurt a bunch of innocent robots like that?
...By now, you must have heard of the dread manna. The masters of the magimechs you faced were transformed by its terrible power.
And thus, they were left to wander the world, masterless and alone...
For years they roamed, without direction or purpose...
Blimey! What did they do to pass the time, I wonder?
They eked out an existence, waiting for the day when their masters would finally return.
Some stayed in Nazcaä, carving giant stone statues,<NL>or drawing glyphs upon the ground.
Others traveled the world, leaving behind pieces of themselves as they went. Pieces which in time came to be known as "memory stones"...
Thus, they came to develop what might even be called a primitive culture...
So...those pictures on the ground in Nazcaä...<NL>And the waystones we've been using this whole time...<NL>The magimechs did all of that?
That is correct. They were responsible for creating almost all that now remains of the period we call the Sagely Stone Age.
They were leaving signs that their masters could use to find them when they finally returned.
...Little knowing that they would never see them again.
But we, at least, have returned, by the grace of<NL>our Queen.
...And yet we are no more than illusions. Soon, we will vanish as swiftly and as suddenly as we appeared.
Which is why...before that day came...we wished to grant peace to those who had fought so bravely to keep the memory of Nazcaä alive. Who remained so faithful still...
That is all we wanted. That is the truth.
I-I see...
You have helped us achieve all that we wished.<NL>And now, we will vanish once more.
But we have faith that one day our Queen will be restored to her true self.
We'll do everything we can to help Queen Cassiopeia,<NL>I promise!
We pray that you will.
And to that end, we grant you one last gift: the power of the Knights of Nazcaä...
Farewell...
They're gone...
Maybe we should help old Cassopeia out sooner rather than later, eh, Ollie-boy? For their sake, like...
You're right, Mr. Drippy! Let's do it for those three knights. And for everybody in this world!
Now youer talking, Ollie-boy!<NL>Let's get going!
Are you really the one our Queen has led to us?
Those weapons from the Sagely Stone Age were built for use in harsh environments. This information may prove useful in your search.
Marvelous. I am pleased to find that we gravely underestimated your powers.
Magimech masters still stand guard over the remains of the three great cities of Nazcaä.
Truly marvelous work. Our Queen displayed her usual wisdom in leading you to us.
You have earned our undying admiration. A remarkable display!
Even with our Queen's guidance, you have done well to reach the Ivory Tower.
The four magimechs you seek are vastly more powerful than the mere replicas you have faced here in the Ivory Tower. Take care!
Hah! But we expected nothing less, of course...
The magimech master is a far more formidable opponent than any weapon of the Sagely Stone Age you have faced thus far. Be on your guard.
You have displayed impressive fortitude and dedication—and in so doing, you have earned our trust.
Extraordinary! Any doubts we may have harbored about you were ill-founded. You have proven yourself more able than we could ever have hoped.
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
We made it! We're in! Right, let's hunt down the wicked White Witch then, shall we?
She's got taste, mun, I'll give her that. This place is proper beautiful. But it's quiet, mun. Too quiet...
Flipping heck, this place is massive! You'd best keep an eye on youer map, Ollie-boy, or we'll be lost before we've even started!
We've got to do it, mun! We can't go disappointing that Gallus! Let's make an old man happy, shall we?
Looks like we're the only ones who can help Cassiopeia, Ollie-boy. Time to save the day once more!
Oooooooooi! Cassiopeiaaaaaa!!!<NL>Sorry, thought she might pop out from somewhere if I gave her a shout, like.
Eh? It was all in her mind? Crikey! That's one vivid imagination, mun!
Well, a lot's happened, but it's finally time to finish this once and for all. Let's get to it, Ollie-boy!
Looks like this is the last chapter of ouer story, Ollie-boy. You ready to see how it ends?
There's not a speck of dust round by here, eh, mun? Who does the cleaning, I wonder. Must be an absolute flipping nightmare...
This place is flipping massive, mun. Imagine how much the rent must be! Oh, and it must be a nightmare to heat! Crikey!
What keeps this place floating all the way up by here then, d'you reckon? Actually, let's not talk about it. Petrified of flipping heights, I am.
Only way out of here's on Tengri's back, mun. Don't get any silly ideas about jumping unless you fancy ending up flat as a flipping pancake.
All this whiteness, mun! It's blinding me! I can't see a flipping thing! That is you, en't it, Ollie-boy?
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
Any tasks you've not cleared up yet, Ollie-boy? Well worth doing, they are, if you can spare the time.
You know, when all this is over, I'm going to miss—erm... Misbehave, mun! Go crazy, I will. Fairy rarebit for breakfast, babana flans all day long...
Youer not... Ha ha! You are, en't it?<NL>Youer flipping lost! Nice one, Cyril!
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
What's up with you, eh?
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!

Look, Ollie-boy!<NL>That red flower of Pea's is flipping sparkling!
Why not try sticking it on that altar by there? Might as well give it a go, en't it?
Hold on a mo!<NL>That blue flower Pea gave us is glowing!
Try sticking it on that altar thingy, Ollie-boy.<NL>Can't hurt, can it?
Crikey! That yellow flower of Pea's is shining like a flipping shiny thing! Giving my lantern a run for its money, it is!
If I was you, I'd whack it on that altar by there, mun. See if anything happens, like.
...
Ah, it has been a while, has it not?
...Huh!?<NL>S-Sorry, Sir... Have we met?
Heh heh! You really don't know? Well, I suppose I have changed my appearance somewhat since we last met.
What the flipping heck is he on about!?
Oliver, I have been waiting for you.<NL>I have a tale I dearly wish to share with you.
O-Okay...
There was once a kingdom where we now stand. A mighty king united the surrounding lands and established his realm here.
This king treated all his subjects equally, be they humans, animals, or magical creatures. A new era of peace<NL>was dawning...
...Or so it seemed. But there were those who despised the king. Covetous souls who envied his power.
They plotted against him, sowing discord throughout the kingdom, and in so doing set Nazcaä on the road to ruin...
But there my memory becomes hazy. I cannot recall their names, nor even their outward appearance. Were there...twelve?
Even now that my amnesia has been cured, their faces remain hidden to me.
Listen, mun—I'm not sure what you want us to say... It en't as if we've got the first flipping clue what the rotters looked like...
I know that, but I also know that I recorded my fears about them somewhere.
I left a message...a warning, so that when people saw them, they would know to beware. But where...?
...Wait! Yes! I hid it in a magical tome that would never age or decay... The Wizard's Companion!
Which means you must have seen it! Think! I wanted people to know what they looked like... Perhaps...what they wore? Yes...that makes sense!
<color:#1>The robes they wore are described somewhere in that book</color>, along with a warning! You must know where it is!
I'm sure that's the key that will unlock my memories. Please, help me recover what remains of my missing past!
It was they who were at the root of the kingdom's strife. It was they who undermined that noble king. Those twelve evil souls...
But I cannot seem to recall what they looked like.
I am certain that I hid a <color:#1>warning</color> in the magic book you hold. Something to show the reader what they looked like. Please, <color:#1>tell me the name of the garment they wore</color>...
Gah! They all dressed alike...<NL>Why can I not remember what they wore?
Yes! That's right! Now I remember! Those fiends clad themselves in wizard's robes!
I can see them now, deep in deliberation... They were the Council of Twelve! Each member was given the title of...
...Zodiarch. A-And that is not all...
Well come on, mun! Spit it out!<NL>What have you remembered?
I was...there. All those millennia ago... I swore fealty<NL>to the Wizard King. Yes. I now remember. I was a<NL>sage of Nazcaä...
You were!? But that means—<NL>Did you know Cassiopeia!?
Wh-What? How do you know that name?<NL>Cassiopeia... Queen Cassiopeia...<NL>It was so long ago...
I have sensed her spirit at times, over the years. It is unmistakably her... But I know not what befell her.
I think I'd better take over here...<NL>Now, pay attention, 'cos I'll only say this once...
...I-I see. So Queen Cassiopeia... She...
...She gave in to the darkness. And that ash I saw fall on Ding Dong Dell—that was her doing?
But Oliver, you really might be the one to save her.<NL>The Wizard King entrusted you with his wand, after all.
Oh, we'll save her, Sir! I just know we will!
Ah, that's the spirit! Of course, the Wizard King's wand is not yet at full strength...
Flipping heck! Not this again!
Ha! Fear not! To one who was once called the Sage of Ages, it is but a trifling matter.
Eh? So we don't have to go traipsing round after magic stones, then? Thank flip for that...
Now, let me begin...
Awake, O wand of the Wizard King!<NL>Awake, O Astra!
So...it's, uh...all ready to go now, huh?<NL>Gee... Thank you, Sir!
The true power that dwells within a wand can sometimes require effort to be drawn out.
I believe that you alone can harness the full power of Astra. With it, you will be able to cast spells that only a king among wizards has ever wielded.
I sure hope so!
And youer sure youer all right setting the likes of us loose with such snazzy spells? We've just met you, after all.
Heh heh. You have never had a problem accepting spells from me before!
You what!? What do you mean "before"!? ...Hold on a minute. Youer not telling me...
You're Horace!?
Heh heh! I was wondering when the guilder would drop. Better late than never. Indeed, I was once the sage known as Horologium...or Horace, to my friends.
Who'd have thought a mouthy little brat like Horace would've grown up to be so important-looking, eh?
How many times must I tell you? I was the Sage of Ages! I was no normal boy!
Wow. So does this mean you finally got your memory back?
Indeed it does. And I have much to thank you for.
Now, there is little I can do to save Queen Cassiopeia in my current state.
I am afraid that I must humbly ask you to do all in your power to free her from the darkness.
Sure thing, Horace!<NL>We'll save her! You see if we don't!
You are a brave and pure-hearted warrior, Oliver.<NL>I will pray for your success.
You are a brave and pure-hearted warrior, Oliver.<NL>I believe you can save Cassiopeia.
.........<NL>...............!
Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
Knickers! This doesn't look good, Ollie-boy!
Huh!? Wh-What's the matter, Mr. Drippy?
I dunno exactly... I just got a bad feeling is all.<NL>Tingle in the old lantern, like.
That one's different from those other rifts, I'm telling you. There's something nasty lurking in there. Proper nasty.
We're in for a battle and a half, or I en't the Lord High Lord of the Fairies—which I am. Anyway, what's the plan,<NL>Ollie-boy?
I... I guess we fight.<NL>We have to do something!
There's brave, you are! Nice one, Ollie-boy!<NL>You've got some flipping bottle, you have!<NL>Then again, you ARE the savior of ouer world!
Now, watch youerself!<NL>Here it comes!
There's clever, Ollie-boy. It never pays to rush into things headlong. Take youer time and get good and ready.
Examine the black orb?
......
Oliver. There is something I need to tell you.
What is it, Horace?
I must tell you about Nazcaä and Cassiopeia.<NL>...And about myself.
Before you attempt to save Cassiopeia, you deserve to know the truth.
It may take some time, but I hope you can spare the time to listen to what I have to say.
Thank you, Oliver.
Our story begins here long ago, where the kingdom of Nazcaä once flourished.
Though it may appear bleak and barren now, in those days, it was a mighty empire that combined mighty magic with advanced technology.
It was a prosperous realm where poverty and pestilence were all but unknown, and its people enjoyed a life of peace and plenty.
But man was never wont to count his blessings, and greed soon reared its ugly head. In spite of all they had, the populace demanded more.
Friends turned upon one another, families were torn apart, and each citizen strove to better his own lot and outdo his neighbor.
Sounds like a recipe for a right old mess, that!
And indeed it was. It led to a series of conflicts that would span centuries. The Wizard Wars.
But the course of history was changed with the arrival of a single wizard...
Wow! One wizard made that big of a difference?
Indeed. This wizard wielded not one, but two wands. His mastery of magic was unparalleled, and he soon turned the tide of the war.
Through his power, the bitter conflict that many thought would never end was brought to a conclusion in the space of mere days.
Crikey... Sounds like someone you'd want on youer side in a fight!
He was indeed, fairy. He was lauded as a hero by all the peoples of the world, and his reward was the crown of Nazcaä.
Thus did he become the Wizard King.
The Wizard King... Cassopeia's father...
The very same. Now, shortly after peace returned to the world, the Wizard King hid one of his wands in the distant land of Autumnia.
He sealed it away, that it might never be used for evil.
Which brings me to my latest puzzle. It has been some time since I last posed you a question, has it not?
I guess it has, huh...
Excellent. My question is this: what was the name of the wand that the Wizard King sealed away? I believe that you know it well...
Speak to me again when you have your answer.
As you wish. I did not mean to impose...
So, what is your answer, Oliver?<NL>What was the name of the wand?
I am certain that it is a name you are very familiar with.
Indeed. It was the very wand that you carry with you now.
I wonder how the valley where it was sealed fares...
In those days, it was filled with the most beautiful flowers...
...Let us continue our tale there.
I will be waiting for you, Oliver.<NL>Come and find me.
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
Flowerpots? Whatever next!?
So this is some kind of ancient Nazcaän altar, is it? I feel like a flipping archaeologist, mun!
So where exactly was this kingdom of Nazcaä, then? I can't see hide nor hair of it round by here...
Look at that! It's all glowing in the middle there! Let's go and have a look, shall we?
There's something funny about that stone in the middle there. Feel it in my lantern, I can...
Pea's awfully quiet all of a sudden.<NL>Is she okay, d'you reckon?
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
Well, if you'd have asked me what I thought was down by here, I don't think I'd ever have guessed it would be...whatever the heck this is.
What do you think they built this place for, eh? Ooh, could be for sacrifices or something... There's grisly...
What's this floor made of, eh? If it's stone, it en't like any I've seen before. Then again, I'm no geologist...
Tell you what, mun—this would be a cracking place to watch birds from. If youer into that sort of thing, of course. I en't. Boring, it is. Ahem.
First them funny pictures on the ground out there, and now this. It's proper mysterious round by here, eh, Ollie-boy?
Want me to say something, do you? Sorry, mun, I got nothing for you. Not a sausage. Nada. Diddly-squat. Zero. Er...zilch.
What's up with you, eh?
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
No rush, Ollie-boy. Let's take it easy for a bit.
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
You should have a read of youer Wizard's Companion once in a while, mun. It's the wizardly thing to do.

Arr! If we engineers didn't keep a careful eye on her, the old Iron Wyvern would come crashing to the ground in no time!
Graharrr! Don't look so worried, lad!<NL>She'll not break down on my watch!
Blast...<NL>It's no good...
Is something wrong?
Well, see...I was carrying out a few checks on the engines, and I happened across a part that needs replacing.
But I've no spares to hand.
Gee... Hey, but doesn't that mean...?<NL>How is the Iron Wyvern flying with a broken engine?
I've jury-rigged a solution for now, but she'll not last long. She could be in for a bumpy ride...
Jeepers creepers!<NL>You mean it could—
Plunge to the ground in a ball of fiery disaster!?
Belay there, you addle-pated worry-worts! I've patched her up well enough to keep her aloft till now, and I'll keep her aloft a while longer yet!
There's reassuring...
Still, this is a patch-up I can't be sure of.<NL>'Tis the engine, after all...
Aye, the engines are the heart of the old beast. And here I am too busy to go in search of fresh parts...
Arrr, if only there were a mechanical-minded soul who could repair this here <color:#1>broken booster</color> for me...
Somebody good with mechanical things?<NL>Hey, I know just the person!
I'll bet <color:#1>Rusty</color> back in Motorville can fix it!
Rusty...? Oh yeah!<NL>Myrtle's dad, you mean?
Truly? You know someone? Then I beg of you—ask this Rusty fellow if he can't take a look at me <color:#1>broken booster</color>!
Thank you kindly! If you fix it, I'll be forever in your debt, lad! And better yet, the old girl might not fall out of the sky!
Tidy! Let's get over to Motorville then, shall we?
Sure! Let's go!
Arrr, that's a blow lad, I'll not lie.<NL>Have you no compassion in your heart?
The engines are looking none too shipshape...
I've jury-rigged a solution for now, but she'll not<NL>last long...
But if the engines break, the Iron Wyvern will fall out of the sky! What are you going to do?
There's naught more I can do, lad. Our only hope is to find someone who can mend this here <color:#1>broken booster</color>.
Hey, what about <color:#1>Rusty</color>! He's the best mechanic in all of Motorville! I'll bet he could fix it!
Hurry, lad! I need you to fix that part for me, or the old flying tinpot's not long for the skies!
It's mended! Arrr, thank the skies! Now I can bring me beloved engines back up to full steam!
Neato! And we won't have to worry about the Iron Wyvern falling out of the sky anymore!
Hahaharrr! That you won't, lad!<NL>Here—a little booty for your trouble.
Arr, you might as well take this, too.
I found it at the bottom of a pile of plunder.<NL>Looks like a recipe or some such...
Whatever it is, I'm sure it'll be of more use to a wizard such as yourself than it will to me!
Arr, the old bird's shipshape again—and we're free to sail the skies without fear of the world below coming up to say hello!
Where is it?<NL>Where can the cursed thing have gone?
Have you lost something?
That I have. And not just anything—I've lost me<NL>lucky charm!
Your lucky charm?
Aye, lad. We sky pirates won't so much as look up at the clouds without a <color:#1>gustplume</color> to protect us!
They keep the wind beneath our wings, and the song of the skies in our hearts!
Gee... It sounds like they're really important to you.
That they are, lad, that they are!<NL>And without mine, I feel naked as a babe!
Say now...you wouldn't consider finding me a new <color:#1>gustplume</color>, would you?
You will? I'm in your debt, lad!<NL>I'll not forget it!
Gustplumes can be plundered from beasts known as <color:#1>beachheads</color>. They prowl <color:#1>the seas round these parts</color>.
Aye, aye, Sir!<NL>Leave it to us, Mr. Sky Pirate!
I'm counting on you, laddie!
You won't? But what am I to do?<NL>Arr, that's a blow, lad. A real blow...
Arrr, where can me precious lucky charm have got to?
Your lucky charm?<NL>What's that?
Why, a <color:#1>gustplume</color>, of course! We sky pirates won't so much as look up at the clouds without one to protect us!
Say now...you wouldn't consider finding me a new one, would you?
Arrr! That's the one, lad! And a fine one it is, too!<NL>A gustplume—the greatest shipmate a sky pirate ever had!
With this little beauty in me pocket, I'll not fear the fiercest of storms!
That's swell!<NL>I'm glad we could help.
Arr, but where's me manners?<NL>Here—'tis the least I can do.
You have to find me one, lad!<NL>Me life depends upon it!
I've still got the gustplume you found me, shipmates!<NL>I'll not lose this one, you may lay to that!
We sky pirates each carry a gustplume to protect us. As lucky charms, you might say.
Haharrr! It may sound a little poetic for the likes of us, but believe me, it's as true as the sky is broad!
Ahoy there, lad!<NL>How go the preparations for the final battle?
Uh, I... They're fine. There's, um...something I wanted to ask you, Captain Kublai.
Well? Spit it out, then!<NL>You'll get nowhere playing coy with me!
Did you ever hear of somebody called Kublai Khan the Third?
Grrr! How did you come to hear of that name?
So you have heard of him?
Aye, of course I've heard of him. He was father of my father's fathers. What business do you have with the<NL>old dog?
A boy gave us a pirate treasure map in Castaway Cove.
And when we followed it, we found all these monuments, and the letters carved on them spelled out "Kublai 3."
Is that so...?<NL>Makes sense, I suppose...
Legend has it that the third to bear the name of Kublai Khan was captain of a band of bloodthirsty pirate scoundrels.
His name was known and feared in his day.<NL>But that was many an age ago now...
Wow! So he was a real-life pirate legend, huh?
More than that—a hero!
Tales tell that no matter how much he plundered, he could spend it all in an instant!
Um... That doesn't sound very heroic...
Sounds flipping idiotic, if you ask me...
Gahahahaharrr!<NL>Aye, you may be right there!
The legends also speak of a treasure that was worth more to him than any other.
They do? Gee!<NL>Do you think it could really have existed?
Aye, lad. I know little of it, but they say he carried it with him to his dying day.
Crikey! Must have been one tidy treasure for a legendary pirate not to want to let it go!
They say it was finally hidden away <color:#1>in the depths of a forest on an island somewhere</color>.
An island so inhospitable that <color:#1>no ship could reach it</color>.
Flip, mun! We've got to find it!<NL>Come on, Ollie-boy! It's treasure-hunting time!
Neato!<NL>I sure hope we can find it!
If you do, you'd best set aside my share of the spoils, or I'll have your thieving guts for garters! Gahahahaharrr!
So the King of the Sky Pirates' great-great-great-grandad was a pirate himself, eh? Looks like skulduggery runs in the family.
Gahahaharrr!<NL>That it does, fairy, and don't you forget it!
Ahoy there, lad!<NL>Did you find that treasure yet?
Ahoy there, lad!<NL>All's shipshape, I hope?
Flip, mun, no mun...<NL>This'll never do...
Crikey, boys.<NL>You don't look too chirpy.
Oh. How do, Drippy-boy!<NL>Here, listen to this, right.
We finally went and opened ouer shop, and not a single flipping fairy has popped in. Tragic, it is!
I just don't know where we're going wrong, mun.<NL>We got some proper tidy stock in and everything...
I'll tell you where youer going wrong—opening a shop up here, you numbskulls! What fairy's ever going to end up by here?
I feel kinda sorry for them, Mr. Drippy.<NL>Isn't there something we can do?
All right, all right, let's have a think... Well, there en't much we can do about the location, but...
Of course! Crikey, I'm clever!<NL>Here, what are youer flagship products?
Er...sorry, we don't sell ships, mun...<NL>I s'pose we could order you one in if—
Flagship PRODUCTS, I said, you flipping halfwit! You know—exclusive stuff! Stuff you can only get by here!
Make youerselves the exclusive stockists of some unique high-end items, and they'll be queuing up round the, er...deck, mun.
You reckon? Tidy. Where do we get us some of<NL>them, then?
Leave that to me, mun.<NL>Got loads of flipping brilliant ideas, I have!
Youer joking, en't you? I'm not letting you go off on a spending spree while I'm stuck by here slaving away at the shop, you work-shy so-and-so!
Drippy-boy, you lot can find us some proper good stuff, en't it, though?
Sure we can! Leave it to us! Say, Smiley—can you tell us what ideas you had?
'Course, mun! My first amazing idea was to go back home and ask everyone in <color:#1>the Fairyground</color>.
There's so many people down by there, one of them's bound to have an idea!
So youer amazing idea is to keep asking people until you find someone with an actual idea, is it? And to think I doubted you...
Ta, mun. I knew you'd like it! Also, I reckon we need some proper quirky stuff, so try asking someone with <color:#1>an eye for comedy</color>, too.
An eye for comedy, eh? Well, there's an obvious candidate for that, en't there?
Indeed, mun, indeed! And she's been around a tidy while, too. Reckon she must know something.
That's why I thought of asking her, see. My ideas are proper tidy and everything, but her ideas might be good too, en't it, though?
Yeah, could be that. Or, more likely, youer ideas are a load of flipping rubbish!
Oh, and there was another one I had. <color:#1>When we were littlies</color>, one of us used to always go on about these amazing weapons he'd dreamed up.
It was a tidy while back, though, so I can't remember much about it... Proper quirky ideas, they were, though... Well weird...
Oh yeah, mun! Little feller, en't it, though?<NL>Smelled funny.
Yeah, that was him, mun!<NL>Oh, I remember now—it was you!
What!? No it flipping wasn—!<NL>...Knickers.
You used to draw them all over the place, en't it, though? Reckon there must be <color:#1>some of youer graffiti left somewhere</color>...
Well, looks like a trip to the Fairyground's on the cards, en't it? Let's go and find these boys some one-off<NL>wonder weapons!
Let's go! We'll be right back, you guys!
Tidy! Ta-ra for now!
If you get stuck, just come back and ask us, en't it, though?
Knickers. There's tragic...<NL>What about my brilliant ideas...?
We can't leave ouer fledgling business untended, is it? Drippy-boy, can you go and find us some of them exclusive flagship thingies?
First thing you need to do is ask around <color:#1>the Fairyground</color> and see if anyone's got any tidy ideas for one-off products for ouer boutique.
Next, we need some proper quirky stuff, so find <color:#1>someone with an eye for comedy</color>, en't it, though?
Yeah, mun, and if you could find us one of them ideas for funny weapons from <color:#1>when we were littlies</color> too, that would be well good!
Reckon there must still be some <color:#1>scribbled on a wall or something somewhere</color>. No idea where, though...
Tidy! Looks like you've got youerselves one of them brilliant ideas!
Now all you need to do is ask someone with a proper <color:#1>good eye for comedy</color> if they've got any ideas of their own for funny weapons.
Yeah, mun, and if you could find us one of them ideas we had <color:#1>when we were littlies</color> too, that would be well good!
Now you just need to <color:#1>ask around the Fairyground</color> and see if anyone down by there's got any brainwaves to share with us.
Yeah, mun, and you should find someone with a proper <color:#1>good eye for comedy</color> and see if they've got any ideas of their own for funny weapons, too!
Youer a legend, mun!
Tidy! Looks like you've got youerselves a couple of them brilliant ideas!
Now if you could just find us one of them ideas for funny weapons from <color:#1>when we were littlies</color> too, we'll have the full set!
Nearly there, my lovelies!<NL>Keep up the good work!
Sorry to keep you waiting, boys!<NL>We got them ideas you were after!<NL>Dunno if they'll be any use, but...
Flip, mun! You did? Tidy!<NL>Gis a look, then!
I knew you wouldn't let us down, Drippy-boy!<NL>This stuff is gold, mun! Gold!
Eh? You reckon?<NL>Mam's one was flipping rubbish, I thought...
Nah, mun, don't be stupid, mun! Proper bangers, these are!<NL>En't it though, Smiley?
...No. It en't, though.
We're still missing something, and my dream weapon shop won't be complete till we've got it.
Crikey, there's no pleasing some people, is there?<NL>Go on, then. What is it?
Well, see... It's...
What is it?
We need a souvenir...of the Great Sage Alicia!
Wh-What!? Why?<NL>Alicia is...
I know, mun, I know. She's gone.<NL>But that's why it'd be so special, en't it?<NL>A proper relic, you know. A real talking point!
But...where can we find one of those?
Where indeed, Ollie-boy...<NL>Hang on! Of course! Allie, en't it?
Huh? My mom?
Yeah, mun! Youer mam was the Great Sage Alicia before she went to youer world, wasn't she?
So any old thing of youer mam's counts as a souvenir of the Great Sage, en't it?
Oh...I see. Isn't that...stretching it a little?
Nah, mun! It's not a lie, is it?<NL>It's all in how you sell it!
Tidy. That's decided, then.<NL>Let's go and find something, shall we?
A souvenir of the Great Sage Alicia?<NL>Good luck with that, you lot.<NL>I wouldn't have the first clue where to look.
I doubt youell find anything of hers left in this world... Anyway! We trust you, Drippy-boy! Youell come through for us, I know you will!
You and Alicia were butties, en't it?<NL>Went off traveling together and everything...
Brace youerselves, boys!<NL>We come bearing proper good news!
Nice one, Drippy-boy! We knew you wouldn't let us down! Go on, then—what've you got for us?
Crikey, there's interesting... So the Great Sage Alicia was proper fond of something called a "frying pan," is it?
That's right. Um, it's not a weapon, but—
Shut it, you! I mean—let me finish, will you, Ollie-boy?
Yeah, so...it en't technically a weapon, but she used it to absolutely murder some...sausages. What d'you reckon? You can do something with this, en't it?
'Course we can, mun! It's an absolute banger!
Ta, mun. Seriously. Ouer new stock's going to bring them flocking from miles around!
Here. This is to say ta, like.<NL>Go on, take it.
Crikey, and to think we started out thinking that umbrella thingy was ouer star item!
En't it, though? What kind of weapon shop specializes in umbrellas? Bonkers, we must've been!
Oh, come to mention it, that means the formula's going spare now, en't it? Here, have this, too!
It's a bit of a pain to make, but try it out, mun.<NL>You never know, it might come in handy.<NL>Save it for a rainy day, en't it?
Righto! Let's sell ouer faces off, shall we?<NL>Roll up! Roll up! Roll down, roll sideways!<NL>We don't care, as long as you roll ouer way!
How do? These flagship thingies of ouers are selling like billy-o, mun! We're making out like flipping bandits!
Arr, we skyfarers love nothing more than throwing a few ingredients together to make something, be it a meal or a mechanical marvel.
Really? I thought you spent all your time plundering and pillaging...
Aye, that we do. But we wouldn't be able to sail the skies if we had to rely on others for the day-to-day necessities now, would we?
It's as Captain Kublai always says: only the craftiest among us will live to spend our plunder below!
Gee, it sounds like a hard life.
It is, lad, it is. And it's not just crafty we have to be—it's creative, too. I'm forever jotting down new formulae, you know.
Sounds a bit too much like hard work to me, this sky-pirating lark...
It sure does. They're even tougher than I thought. Say, would you mind if we took a look at your formulae?
Mind? Of course not, lad! Nothing gives me more pleasure than to share a recipe or two! May they serve you well!
You received some new alchemy formulae!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
May my formulae serve you well on your travels, lad!
Well, hello there, Sir! We spent a tidy while putting<NL>this stuff together, why don't you spend a tidy pile<NL>buying it, eh?
Ta! May ouer excellent items enable you to save the world swiftly, and in stunning style!
Good day, Sir! Might I interest you in some of our flagship products? Speak to my colleague Smiley there if anything takes youer fancy!
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
We need to go and give those boys their pieces of art back, en't it.
S'pose we'd better go and make my mam laugh, eh?
Come on, mun! We need to get inside my mam, en't it?
We've got some unfinished business back inside my mam, mun!
We need to go and help those littlies!<NL>Pronto!
Come on, there's a slide in my mam's tum just waiting for us to go down it!
It's off to see the Empire, the wonderful<NL>Empire of Hamelin! In Autumnia!
Let's hurry up and get ouerselves to Hamelin, shall we?
D'you see any sages round by here?<NL>I flipping don't!
Reckon youer going to get some Hamelin armor round by here, do you? Well I flipping don't!
Oi, what do you think youer doing, ditching youer piggy armor and running off?
What exactly does this have to do with sneaking ouer way into the palace in Hamelin, hm?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?
We going back to the palace in Hamelin, or what, mun?
Let's get some belief off that Marcassin, shall we?
Come on, mun! Let's give Marcassin his belief back!
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
Something proper wrong is going on, mun! I can feel it in my lantern! Go careful now, Ollie-boy...
Keep youer eyes peeled, Ollie-boy! I've got a bad feeling about this flying ship thingy...
You go on ahead, Ollie-boy. I'll keep an eye out back by here. Yeah, way back by here. Where it's safe...
Let's go and have a look at the pooer dab first, shall we? You never know, you might be able to magic him back to health, en't it?
Well, if he's in this cave, he can't be far off. There's not exactly much room to hide a dragon round by here...
These flying dragons—they don't breathe fire all over the place like that other one, do they? Proper annoying, that was...
You've got a spell that lets you talk to animals, en't it? Have a flick through youer Wizard's Companion if you can't work out which one it is.
What kind of a noise is that for a dragon to make?<NL>Sounds more like a flipping budgie, mun!
Well, there's no doubt about it—something fishy's going on with that dragon. And I don't mean his breath...
How come Esther didn't sweet talk that red dragon, too...? There's weird... Oh! Nothing! Carry on, Ollie-boy!
Reckon we can sort this out one way or another, eh? Let's go and tell that Kublai, en't it!
Did you see all the treasure out by the back there? Loads of it, there was! Reckon I might grab mys— Oh, nothing. Don't mind me, mun. As you were!
What sort of person shares their soul with a dragon, d'you reckon? Mind you, he's not exactly the toughest dragon around...
Crikey! Imagine what sort of familiars you'll get once they do their final metamorphosis, mun! They might even be as fierce as old Kublai!
Why's he saying ouer familiars'll be as tough as his dragon? We already beat the flipping thing, mun! Final form familiars would make mincemeat of it!
Motorville, mun! And make it snappy!
I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Finding someone with a bit too much confidence for their own good shouldn't be a problem, eh? Oi! What are you looking at me like that for?
There must be plenty of confident people kicking about the place, mun. Ah-ha! What about old Pirateface? He's proper full of himself!
Crikey! Looks like Shadar's starting to get his manky old claws into youer world as well now, Ollie-boy! We need to stop that rotter, and fast!
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Time to see how Tengri's doing, I reckon. Let's go and ask old Kublai, shall we?
Now Denny's all better, Tengri should be back to his old self too, eh?
D'you reckon I'll ever be able to see that Pea? Probably, eh. I'll just have to be patient, en't it? Can't wait to finally see what she looks like...
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
Back for another look at that map of the stones then, en't it, Ollie-boy?
The whole thing was a wild flipping goose chase, mun! When I get my hands on the rotter who drew this map, I'll flipping throttle him!
Gis a go on that dragon horn, Ollie-boy! Go on! Just one parp! Come on, mun! Don't be a spoilsport! Ach, youer no flipping fun, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
Let's find that last stone shall we, mun?
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!
What do you reckon's going on with that soldier from Xanadu over in front of the palace in Hamelin, eh?
Time to take a trip on old Tengri, I reckon!
Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell,<NL>the rotter!

Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun!<NL>Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now 'til the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea to, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!

Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
What kind of weirdo sets up camp all the way out by here, eh? The nearest shop must be flipping weeks away, mun.
You can say what you like about caves, but they're lovely and cool, en't it? Feel that breeze... Ahh, there's soothing...
Who carved that big skull thing over the entrance, anyway? Proper tasteless, that is! I'd have a nice bust of youers truly or something...
Did you see all them treasure chests, Ollie-boy? Shedloads, there was! No one would mind if I took a couple, would they? Oh, you reckon they would?
Sky pirates en't too different from youer common or garden sea pirates. They're just that little bit...skyier, en't it.
Who would do something like this, mun? Turning people into monsters is proper flipping wrong...
I can see her! I can finally see young Pea! And she's only a littlie! There's surprising!
You ready for this, Ollie-boy?
Time to invade the Ivory Tower! You've stocked up on sandwiches and such, I take it? Tidy! Let's get cracking!
D'you really think Cassiopeia will be in there? I'm proper nervous, mun...
Here, d'you reckon you can see Teeheeti from up by here? I might stick my head over the edge and give Mam and the boys a quick wave...
Bit flipping windy up here, en't it? You want to watch youerself, Ollie-boy. Don't want to get blown away now, do you?
They're not bad these airship thingies. We should build one of ouer own. A massive one—call it the Driptanic! There's classy!
Who d'you reckon built this thing, eh? Looks like the work of that piggy lot down by Hamelin. Who says pigs can't fly! Ha!
How do they make a great big hunk of metal like this fly, eh? Must be some sort of magic, en't it? ...What's that? Aerody-what?
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
Any tasks you've not cleared up yet, Ollie-boy? Well worth doing, they are, if you can spare the time.
No rush, Ollie-boy. Let's take it easy for a bit.
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
Wahey!
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
Let's start the new day as we mean to go on, shall we? Best foot forward, and last one in's a rotten egg!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
What's up with you, eh?

Drippy, mun!<NL>What are you doing by here!?
And how did you get in!?
Don't start with youer chattering now, mun!<NL>I'm on my break, en't it!
KEYAAARGH!
Nasty! Nasty!<NL>Beastie! Beastie!
(gasp) M-Mr. Drippy! Look!
Oh, knickers! If we don't do something quick, that rotter's going to make himself a littlie omelet!
We have to save him!
Quickly! Quickly!
Scary! Scary!
Safety! Safety!
Knickers! Knickers!
Help me! Help me!<NL>Quickly! Quickly!
Nasty! Nasty!
Tidy! Next! Next!
I'm not like the other littlies, you know.<NL>Gifted, I am, like! That's what my teacher says, anyway...
To be honest, I can't wait to get out of here. This place en't conducive to my intellectual development, see. I reckon these boys might be holding me back.
Ta, mun! Ta!
Tidy! Tidy!
Out, mun, out!<NL>Outside! Outside!

Oh no, another one!
Quickly, Ollie-boy!<NL>We've got to save those littlies!
HOOORAAARGH!
PLESSSSSS!
Lend me youer ears a sec, Ollie-boy, there's something I've got to tell you.
What's that, Mr. Drippy?
Those steps by there are the emergency exit out of Mam's guts. We call them the <color:#1>back passage</color>, see.
The back passage?
That's right, mun. So if you ever need to get out of Mam's guts in a hurry, just nip up those stairs.
Uh...sure.<NL>But...what's to stop the littlies doing the same?
Don't be daft, mun. They en't baby steps, are they! Way too high for a littlie, they are.
Now, the back passage will take you straight to the Fairyground, so you can come and go as you please, en't it!?
Huh...? So...we could have used them to get in here in the first place?
Well...yeah, I s'pose... But where's the fun in that, mun!? Always been one for a grand entrance, me! Got my reputation to think of, en't it?
Geez...
This is the <color:#1>Rose Room</color>, Ollie-boy!
Here we are, Ollie-boy!<NL>The <color:#1>Tulip Room</color>!
Ah, the <color:#1>Daffodil Room</color>!<NL>The name alone brings a tear to my eye!
This is the <color:#1>Violet Room</color>, Ollie-boy! What? Did you think it was going to be purple or something?
No amount of wand-waving will get this door open, Ollie-boy! Let's start with the rooms that are unlocked, and take it from there!
Now, all we've got to do is hop on this slide, and we'll be out of Mam's guts before you know it! You ready to go, Ollie-boy!?
What are you waiting for, mun!? All you've got to do is sit on youer bottom and let gravity do its thing!
Hey, look, Mr. Drippy!<NL>There's something written here!
Oh yeah!<NL>What does it say, then?
"I made some gloves from the claws of a crab,
"That I found stone dead on the beach, pooer dab.
"They carved my foes up something lush,
"But turned my flipping hands to mush."
...
Uhh...
...Turned his own hands to mush?<NL>Well, that's no flipping good, is it!
You got the idea for the flawed claws!
"I made some gloves from the claws of a crab
Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
Not another flipping rift, mun!?<NL>Here, in Mummy's Tummy!?
Hang on a minute...<NL>She didn't...
She couldn't have...
She only blinking ate the thing, didn't she!?
I'll be having words with her about this!<NL>But let's have a look at that orb first, shall we?
Right you are, Ollie-boy!<NL>I've got a good feeling about this one!
We can't just leave something like that inside<NL>my mam, mun!
Examine the black orb?
Ahh, it's great to be back in the old girl! Long time no see, mamguts!
Welcome to my alma mater, my lovelies!<NL>I never get tired of that one...
I hope nothing horrible's happened to the littlies. I can't stand the sight of yolk, mun...
So there's more littlies need rescuing, is it?
How the heck did beasties get in here, mun? We'd better help the rest of the littlies before things get ugly!
Aww, look at the little lovelies, following us all in a row! There's endearing!
The door to the Rose Room's open, Ollie-boy!<NL>It's down near the end, en't it!?
Don't tell me they've got rid of the Peach Room, mun! That was my flipping classroom! Criminal, that is!
It's a bit different by here than it was in my day. Ah well, times change, I s'pose...
Righto! On to the next room!
There's more of them to save, mun! On with the show!
This lot are following us too, mun! Proper cute, that is!
That's another door open, en't it? Let's get on and save some more littlies!
Next up, the Tulip Room! You know which one that is don't you, Ollie-boy? Don't tell me you don't know youer flowers!?
What room's next then, eh?
These ones are following us now as well! Look at them all! Dear of them!
It's the Daffodil Room next, Ollie-boy! Ahh, what a noble flower! Flower of my fathers!
Where's my dear old Peach Room, mun? Don't tell me they've... Ooh, the rotters!
There's more! Crikey, Mam! How many have you got hidden away down by here!?
There's a way to go yet, mun! Sure you don't want to take a quick restorative break in the staff room?
This lot coming too, are they? Tidy! Come along now, littlies! Follow me!
Not much longer now, Ollie-boy! Knuckle down, and it'll be over in no time!
Flipping heck, mun! They've only gone and got rid of my dear old Peach Room! The rotters!
Next stop, the Violet Room! Soon to be renamed the Violent Room! Tidy!
You've been on a slide before, en't it, mun? Just plonk youerself on youer bottom and away you go! Tidy!
Right then! Next step's easy-peasy! All you got to do is take a ride on that there slide, mun!
You'd best be ready before you hop on that slide, Ollie-boy! There's no sliding back up the thing!

We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?

Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!

Used to get sent to the staff room all the time, I did. Naughtiest littlie in the faycare center three years running, I was! Ahh, golden days...

So, Ollie-boy, what'll it be today?<NL>The casino is youer oyster, my lad!
I'm all for a bit of rest and relaxation, just don't go forgetting youer reason for being by here in ouer world will you, Ollie-boy?
It's certainly an interesting spot for a casino, but it's not exactly well-placed for passing trade, is it, mun? It's dead, in fact!
Look at all these skellingtons, mun! I'll make no bones about it, they scare me to death! Can't scare themselves to death, after all...
You sure youer familiars en't getting peckish, Ollie-boy? Best have a check, en't it?

Oh! What's that I spy? A cauldron? Hah haaah!<NL>The boy is a WIZARD! A visiting wizard boy!
Huh? ...You know about cauldrons?
Yah hah haaah! There's nothing I DON'T know about cauldrons, young man! You're not the only wizard in this cave, you see!
They call me "The Alchemist"! No one alive knows more about cauldrons and formulae than I!
But I'm more than happy to pass my knowledge on to the next generation. So how about it, boy? Do you want to learn some REAL alchemy?
Yah hah haaah! That's the spirit! Good for you!
Now then...where to begin? Ah yes! The alchemical synthesis of a <color:#1>war god's ax</color> seems a fitting subject for a child. Children like axes, don't they?
A war god's ax, eh? Sounds pretty nifty.<NL>Go on then, what do we need to do?
Well... The first thing you need to do is alchemize yourself a <color:#1>demon's ax</color>.
Flipping heck, that doesn't sound half bad either!
Yah hah haaah! You're going to need a <color:#1>grand ax</color>, some <color:#1>black wings</color>, and a <color:#1>tachestone</color> or two...
As for the specific quantities...<NL>You'll just have to work them out for yourself!
Eh? I thought you said you were going to teach us? Got something better to do, have you?
Yah hah haaah! Sooner or later, every wizard must learn to think for himself!
You got it, Sir!<NL>I'll make a demon's ax, you see if I don't!
Yah hah haaah! You've got heart, boy, and that's the most important ingredient in any formula!
Oh. Oh, I see... Well, IF you change your mind...<NL>You know where I am.
This must be fate!<NL>I'm clearly destined to teach you the ways of alchemy.
You do want to learn about alchemy, don't you?<NL>REAL alchemy, I mean!
To make a <color:#1>demon's ax</color>, you're going to need a <color:#1>grand ax</color>, some <color:#1>black wings</color>, and a <color:#1>tachestone</color> or two!
I'm back! And I made myself a demon's ax!
Yah hah haaah! Fine work, boy! I suppose you'll be wanting to know how to make a war god's ax next, yes?
Yes, please!
Well, the first thing you'll need is that <color:#1>demon's ax</color> you<NL>just made.
You'll also need some <color:#1>rainbow-colored fossils</color> and some <color:#1>writings about the mysteries of this world</color>!
Of course, you'll have to work out the quantities<NL>for yourself.
Gee... Those materials sound pretty special, Sir...
Yah hah haaah! You're not wrong there!<NL>The question is: do you have what it takes to find them?
Do I!? Youer talking to the Lord High Lord of the Fairies, mun! Finding stuff is second nature to me! No, first nature!
Yeah, I seem lovable and laid-back, but these sharp eyes don't miss a thing, and once I've spotted what I'm after,<NL>I don't stop till I've made it mine!
And I'll tell you something else: I've got a singing voice an angel would be proud of! There's some that say I'm just a pretty face, but—
Th-That's enough, Mr. Drippy!
Well...I could go on, but...I won't.<NL>Proper modest I am, see.
To make a <color:#1>war god's ax</color>, you'll need your <color:#1>demon's ax</color>, some <color:#1>rainbow-colored fossils</color>, and some <color:#1>writings about the mysteries of the world</color>!
I did it! I made a war god's ax!
Kyaaah hah haaa! Wonderful!<NL>I really didn't think you had it in you, boy!
Well, it wasn't easy...<NL>But I sure learned a lot along the way!
Yah hah haaah! Of course you did! Keep this up, and you'll be a great wizard one day, mark my words!
Now, I want you to have this.<NL>Consider it a reward for all your alchemical endeavors.
I'll also give you some new and exciting formulae<NL>to try out!
Keep up the good work, and someday you may justly be able to call yourself the world's second-greatest alchemist!
The field of alchemy is more complex than you imagine, boy. But if you are curious enough, and dedicated enough, SOME of its secrets MAY reveal themselves to you!
Should you ever stumble upon a material whose use eludes you, however, be sure to pay me a visit!
I will doubtless be able to instruct you on how it might be turned into something spectacular!
Yah hah haaah! So very good to see you again!
Hmm? Is that a <color:#1>heart of the muse</color> you've got there!?
Uh, yeah...I think so. Do you know what it does?
Yah hah hah hah hah! But of course I do, boy!<NL>Though I must admit that even I have never seen one before...
Well, I suppose I'd better give you this.<NL>It looks like you'll be needing it!
Gee, thanks!
Yah hah haaah! Greetings, boy!
Hmm? Is that a <color:#1>cad's clasp</color>!?
Uh... I guess it is. Do you know what it does, Sir?
Yah haaah! I do indeed!<NL>Though I've never seen one before...
Thank you, Sir!
Yah hah haaah! My favorite and only visitor!
(gasp) ...And a <color:#1>cad's clasp</color>, too!?
Oh, these? Yeah, we found them someplace.<NL>Do you know what they're for, Sir?
Yah hah hah hah haaah! I most certainly do!<NL>Truth be told, I have only ever seen pictures of them, but their use is known to me nonetheless.
On which note: take these!<NL>It looks like you'll be needing them!
Yah hah haaah! So good of you to visit!
Hmm? Oho! That's a <color:#1>muse's harp</color>, isn't it!?
And you managed to make it all by yourself...?<NL>Well, well...
I don't suppose a budding master of alchemy has any need for such things, but I'd like you to have it anyway.
Yah hah haaah! You have returned!
(gasp) Do my eyes deceive me? That's a <color:#1>cad's cannon</color>, is it not!?
And this is all your own work, is it?<NL>My, my...
Well, I rather doubt one with your obvious talent for alchemy requires any such assistance, but please—take this.
Kyaaah hah haaa! Good to see you again!
And what's this? A <color:#1>cad's cannon</color>, too!?
And you managed to make them all by yourself...?<NL>Well, well...
I rather doubt one with your obvious talent for alchemy requires any such assistance, but please—take these.
The world of alchemy is deeper than you imagine, boy. Stay curious, though, and some of its secrets MAY reveal themselves to you!
...Though I must say, your alchemical skills look like they need a bit of work.
Come back when you've learned your way around that cauldron of yours. Then I'll teach you some REAL alchemy!
More alchemical inspiration!<NL>Go to the cauldron to see what you can make!
Ahh, it's lovely and cool in here, eh? You'd never know there was a boiling hot desert outside, would you? Tidy!
I don’t see how anyone could live by here, mun—it's poky as anything! Tiny, it is! Even I'd have trouble fitting, and I'm proper petite!
Grass growing under his feet? What is this bloke, eh? Some kind of miracle worker?
Look at all them pots and barrels and that. Reckon there's anything tasty in any of them? I might have a quick poke around, like...
Proper cool in here, en't it. There's relaxing. Makes me want to... (yawn) Ahh... Zzz...

Gee... Is there anything we can do to help?
(gurgle gurgle) Yes! Please find me a <color:#1>potty</color>.<NL>They're full of water. I'm sure one of them could... (splutter) ...help.
You want a...potty? Ohh! That's a kind of creature, huh? I thought you were asking for— Uh, never mind. We'll find you one and be right back!
We brought this, uh, potty along to help you!
(gurgle) A potty!?<NL>W-Wonderful! Thank you!
Ahh... (slosh) That's better. I'm full of water again.<NL>Thank you.
Please, take this. It's the least I can do to say thanks!
(slosh) We're all friends on this island, you know.<NL>We really are.
Everyone on this island is a big fan of yours.<NL>In fact, Toko's got a present waiting for you!
We're all friends on this island, you know.<NL>We really are.
And now you're one of our friends as well!<NL>(splosh)
(sigh) Awww... It gets me down, being the only mushroom on this island. I get so lonely, you know...?
Come on, mun! There might not be any mushroomy mates for you, but there's loads of other creatures by here,<NL>en't it?
Yeah...I know. They're nice, and everything... It's just... They don't know what it's like to be a mushroom...
Well, there en't much you can do about that, short of lending them your ca—
I know, Mr. Drippy! Let's find another <color:#1>mushroom critter</color> and bring him here! They could be best buddies!
I just want to meet another mushroom, you know...?
Don't worry, we'll bring another <color:#1>mushroom critter</color> to this island, and you guys can be best buddies!
Look! We brought you a friend, just like I promised!
R-Really?<NL>Oh, this is great!
Thank you, really. It's just great to talk to another mushroom. Someone who really knows what it's like,<NL>you know...?
Please, take this. It's my way of saying thanks.
You may not be a mushroom, but you're like a mushroom to me. And I mean that.
You've done a lot for the creatures of this island. In fact, I think Toko's got a special present for you...
Meoh! Look! A human!<NL>I haven't seen a human in aaages!<NL>Purrhaps he's got a spare pair of—
Calm down, will you?
...Now, you appear to be travelers.<NL>If that's the case, we've got a purroposal for you...
Uh... What kind of proposal?
We want swords!<NL>One each would be purrfect!
Swords, huh? What kind would you like?
Purretty much any kind would be acceptable... Purrsonally, though, I have a purreference for <color:#1>well-worn swords</color>. Purrhaps you could purrovide two of them?
Oh...so you want two of the same type?
Purrecisely!<NL>We want to purractice together, you see!
Well... All right then!<NL>I'll bring them to you right away!
<color:#1>Two well-worn swords</color>!<NL>That's what we want!
<color:#1>Two well-worn swords</color>, purrlease...
Here you go! I brought those swords you wanted!
Meoh! Thank you so much! These are purrfect!<NL>They're purrecisely the same in every purrticular!
Really now, calm down...
Thank you, travelers. We appurreciate your efforts.<NL>If you'd be so kind as to accept this purresent...
Thanks for the swords!
Rest assured that we will take the necessary purrecautions when purracticing with the swords you purrovided...
I understand we're not the only ones on this island to have purrofited from your help.
We are all indebted to you. You should be purroud<NL>of yourself.
Toko's got a special purresent for you!<NL>It's from everyone on the island!<NL>
We haven't actually done any purractice with the swords you gave us yet.
They may be well-worn, but they just seem so purristine!
Rest assured that we will treat the swords you purrovided with the greatest reverence.

Toko! Toko-ko-to. Toko. Toko-tokooo!<NL>(Nice to see you, friend! Hey, let's go walking one day. You and me. That would make me happy as can be!)
Look out, mun! Beasties! Oh, but hang on... They seem all right around us. Tame, looks like. But not familiars. There's unusual...
Proper mysterious by here, en't it, Ollie-boy? I wonder what the story is with this place...
Look at that, mun! The water's so clear, you can see all the way to the bottom! Can you see any treasure? My eyes en't what they used to be...
D'you know, I reckon you could drink this water if you wanted. You probably wouldn't get sick or nothing. There's pure!
D'you think if we got Esther to play these lot a tune, they'd become youer familiars? That'd be nice and easy, eh, Ollie-boy?

Hey, look! There's something on the floor over here...<NL>It looks like that gentleman's diary!
I reckon youer right, Ollie-boy. Let's have a look now— Oh, knickers! It's soaking wet, mun!
Gee, it really is, huh...
But you can still read it, just about...<NL>I guess it should be okay!
...
Pinch me if I'm dreaming but...are you a human? We don't get many humans in this cave!
Well, there's not a great deal to do here, but I hope you have a cracking time anyway!
Hey, listen to this...
I heard that there's an island far to the west of here that's always covered with thick fog.
None of us crabs go anywhere near the place, of course. The monsters over there are savage—we'd be toast in<NL>no time!
See!? I told you I had the biggest pincers!
What are you on about!? Mine are much bigger! Ohh, you were cracking a joke, right? Funny. Like your tiny claws.
I wonder what's in that green treasure chest.<NL>I bet I could crack it open if I tried...
Got a ship, have you?<NL>Well, just watch out for sea monsters, all right?
They hide themselves under the waves, you see. You just don't know what you're up against until it's too late.
Aaahhh... Ooh! Oh oh oh... Oooh!<NL>Ahhh... This is just—ooh!—cracking!
Well, well. It's not every day we get a visit from a human.
I'd better mark this momentous occasion by giving you a bit of advice. I suppose you've found a shield or two on your travels, have you?
Well, I'm told—don't ask by who—that if you equip your familiars with shields, there's a chance they'll block enemy attacks automatically.
And get this: shields that have a low "defense" rating might actually be better for automatic blocking. Worth bearing in mind, I'd say!
Ah! I see you've got familiars with you!
You do give them the odd treat, don't you?
Offer them their favorite and they'll snap your claw off—and it'll help them grow stronger, too!
Just in case you're wondering, there's no treat I like more than a nice, juicy dumbflounder...
Seeing you reminds me of those other humans who washed up here, ooh, a good while ago now.
I overheard them talking about how they'd found a cave jam-packed with creatures on another island.
I'd have asked them where, only they weren't capable of understanding the simplest of claw-gestures. Humans, eh? Oh, no offense.
Well I'll be a monkey's uncle! A cave like this on Teeheeti? I thought I knew every inch of the place, mun. Clearly flipping not!
Crawling with crabs, en't it? I reckon they must have come in here to avoid getting eaten. Sorry, boys, bad news—I flipping love crab, me!
Knickers! There's painful... Oh, don't worry, mun, I was just imagining getting a nip off one of this lot. (shudder)
Does someone live by here, or what? Look at all them pots and barrels lined up all neat, like. That en't the work of crabs, mun...
Crabs? On Teeheeti? I'd better go up the Fairyground and tell the boys! These'll go down a storm at the restaurants over by there!

...!<NL>...! ...!
Huh? This girl, is she...?
Certainly looks like it, Ollie-boy. In the spirit realm, she is, if I had to take a guess.
I feel like she wants to tell me something...<NL>What should I do, Mr. Drippy?
Eh? Youer joking, right? Do the same thing you always flipping do, Ollie-boy! Cast a <color:#1>spell</color> and save the day,<NL>en't it!?
You...can see me!?
Oh, yes! Yes indeed! But what's a young gho—I mean, girl like you doing over by here, anyway?
Well... I'm worried about my <color:#1>jabberguppy</color>...
We used to always be together, you see.<NL>Ever since I was a little girl...
But then one day, we got caught up in an enormous blizzard while we were out playing, and, well...this happened to me.
The problem is, my jabberguppy hasn't left my side since. I think he's scared...
I'm really worried about him.<NL>He can't stay with me forever...
But... Don't you want to be together?
It's not about what I want. I'm... I'm dead! It's about what's right for him. He has to learn to survive on his own, and get on with his life.
Hey, maybe you could help! Would you mind toughening him up for me? It has to be done!
Crikey, there's mature! Brings a tear to my eye, it does—<NL>I must be getting soft...
Well, the least we can do is give you a hand, en't it?<NL>We'll make youer pal the most self-reliant jabberguppy this side of Hamelin, mark my words!
Really!? Oh, thank you!
So... How about you bring him back here when he's<NL><color:#1>gone up another ten levels</color>?
All right, we'll see you then!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Let's teach this scaredy-guppy the ways of the world!
Oh... I'm sorry. It was rude of me to ask...
Oh... It doesn't look like you can take him with you right now. I think you've got too many familiars...
Maybe you could get somebody to take care of one or two of them for a while?
Ever since I passed away, he's refused to leave my side.<NL>I think he's scared...
Could you come back here when my jabberguppy<NL><color:#1>has gone up another ten levels</color>?
Well then, what do you reckon?<NL>He looks proper hard now, doesn't he?
My darling jabberguppy! I don't believe it!<NL>Those muscles... I don't think you'll have any problems surviving without me now!
Um... Can I ask you one more favor?
Sure! What is it?
Would you mind letting my jabberguppy accompany you on your journey?
He does seem really fond of you, and I'd be happier knowing he wasn't on his own...
Sure! We'll take him with us!
Thank you! Here's a little something for your trouble.<NL>Please be nice to my jabberguppy!
Oh... And I suppose I'd better give you this as well.
I don't think my jabberguppy can metamorphose any more, but maybe this will help one of your other familiars to grow stronger.
Thank you so much for everything.<NL>I'm sad to see him go but...it's for the best.<NL>Be nice to him!
...
...Gup!
Ahh, it's nice to get in out of the wind, mun. Loads better, en't it? Hang on... Nope. Actually it's still flipping freezing!
Looks like some beastie's lair round by here, en't it? And we're in no fit state to fight, mun, shivering like this! Kn-Kn-Knickers!
Look at the size of that icicle, mun! Massive, it is! And if I'm not mistaken, moments from falling and squishing someone flat! Careful, Ollie-boy!
Eh? Could have sworn I saw a flash of green up there somewhere...
Snow's cold as flip—we both know that—but by crikey, is it pretty... Ahh, wish the boys back in the Fairyground could see this, mun...

Hang on a minute...<NL>Youer one of the Golden Grove lot, en't you?

Golden Grove is peaceful again!<NL>It's safe for you to go back now!
What!? Serious? To be honest, I've been having such a good time by here with my new friend, I'd forgotten all about going back.
...But now that you mention it, I do miss the old place.
Hey, thanks for letting me know, boys.<NL>I'll head back to the forest quick sharp, en't it!?
Mwahahaha! Then I shall return to my solitary non-existence... But feel free to c-c-c-come and visit any time!
Crikey! It smells proper ripe in here!<NL>Uncle Dai, is that you, mun?
You don't think the ceiling's going to collapse on us or anything, do you? Sorry, mun, I'm not much good in confined spaces...
Here, you got a pickax or something I can dig with? Reckon I can see a diamond down by here, mun!

You strong!<NL>Thank you!
The forest...our home...<NL>The trees...our friends...

Forest...safe now...<NL>Thank you.
You've got to be proper tidy to get a statue like that made of you, Ollie-boy!
Look, Ollie-boy, some forest dwellers!<NL>Helluva interesting people, they are!
What a tidy little forest this is.<NL>Reminds me of the green, green trees of home, mun...
En't that a green treasure chest over by there?
Ahh, that statue reminds of my hunting days. Me and my butties, tip-toeing through the forest...

We protect our forest!<NL>Keep safe and peaceful!
Too right, mun. Monsters are known to steer well clear of forest dwellers, see. I'd say these are the real forest guardians right here!
Gee, I guess they are!<NL>But I wonder why critters are so scared of them?
We have great weapon!<NL>Name <color:#1>royal spear</color>!
Wow! That sounds kinda neat!
We use cauldron. Make weapons.<NL>You want make <color:#1>royal spear</color>, too?
Huh? You can teach us how to make one?
Tidy! This'll be a good chance for you to practice youer alchemy, Ollie-boy. Let's ask him for a few pointers,<NL>shall we?
Good. I tell you...needed things. Very secret.
<color:#1>Pretty ball. Like glass</color>. Two.<NL><color:#1>Black metal. No rust</color>. Two.<NL><color:#1>Black stone. Shiny. Hard</color>. Two.
That's a bit blinking vague, en't it!?
Kind of sounds like a riddle, huh... All right, let's do our best! Come on Mr. Drippy, it's time to find some materials!
You, weak.<NL>No royal spear. Dangerous.
Tidy! This'll be a good chance for you to practice youer alchemy, Ollie-boy. Let's ask him for a few pointers, shall we?

Ah! Royal spear!<NL>You made, too!
Great! You great weapon maker!
Gee... Thanks!
Take this!<NL>Put in cauldron!
We have great weapon!<NL>You make, too! Take formula!
You...cauldron master!
We have great weapon!<NL>Protect our forest!
You received some new alchemy formulae!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
You weak!
Great weapon...in purple box!<NL>Our treasure...now yours!
Sun's in my eyes, Ollie-boy—must be getting low.<NL>It'll be dark soon...
Proper weird pillar this, en't it?<NL>I wonder what was here before...
Look up there, Ollie-boy!<NL>Up there, mun! On top of that pillar!
The sky's looking helluva peculiar all of a sudden...<NL>I'm feeling a bit edgy and all...
Seeing a sunset like that always reminds me of waiting to go on stage before my headlining slot at the Tidy Titters Comedy Festival... Proper bricking it, I was!

Hmm? Can I give help?
I sure hope so! We're actually looking for a feel-good fungus. I heard you have some here in your forest...
Feel-good...fungus?<NL>I know where you can find.
Gee, really!?<NL>So...would you mind telling us?
Forage feel-good fungus...dangerous.<NL>You find only on top of big tree.
Only my people can go.<NL>I get for you.
Whoa! Really!?<NL>That sure is kind of you!
But, I have request.
Oh, sure.<NL>What can we do for you, Miss?
I want special food.<NL>I want...<color:#1>car-rock-ache</color>.
Car-rock-ache...?
My people hear many rumor—this very, very tasty.
I swap for feel-good fungus.<NL>One car-rock-ache, one fungus.
Uhhh...all right! It's a deal!<NL>We'll be back with your, uh...thing before you know it!
I hungry!<NL>Want to eat <color:#1>car-rock-ache</color>!
But I don't know what a car-rock-ache is, Mr. Drippy...
Yeah, that's got me puzzled and all. Stands to reason it must be an item though, eh. Why not have a rummage through youer bag and see what you can find?
Here you are! I got you the carrot cake you wanted!
Ahh! Car-rock-ache!
Looks very, very tasty!<NL>Thank you!
I got feel-good fungus for you.<NL>Swap time!
Car-rock-ache very, very tasty.<NL>Want to eat more!
Many herbs and mushrooms in forest.<NL>Many people come foraging here.
You eat car-rock-ache?
I eat many times!<NL>Sorry... I boast!
You want mushroom? From forest?<NL>Or herbs, maybe?
East of here...big metal place.<NL>People make hole. Big hole in ground.
This forest...full of herb and mushroom...<NL>Many people...come here to take...
A place like this in the middle of the forest...<NL>Who'd have thought, mun!?
That red treasure chest by there really stands out, mun!
Don't worry if it gets a bit dark in the forest, Ollie-boy. With this lantern on my nose, it'll be my time to shine—literally, mun!
Look, Ollie-boy, a green treasure chest!<NL>Let's get ouerselves in a good position and give it a shot, en't it?

Ahh, but that's just it, mun! He's not trying to say anything, is he! This fellow by here's clearly taken a lifelong ascetic vow of silence, see.
A...vow?
That's right! He doesn't need words to communicate. He's mastered an altogether deeper and more...profounder mode of communication. There's spiritual! Just imagine—

Hee hee! No, no.<NL>Other people just gone away. For short time.

Top drawer, mun. Top drawer!<NL>No one swings a slapstick like you do!
How do, Drippy-boy?<NL>Long time no see, mun!
What do you reckon to this forest, then?<NL>Pretty tidy, en't it?
This old girl's got some right tidy tales, I'm telling you!
...and then you says something stupid, and then I slaps you, en't it?
Like this!
Actually, no. More like...
THIS!
Nice and relaxed round by here, en't it?<NL>Makes me feel like having a nice nap.
(sniff) Hang on a minute... (sniff sniff) If my nose doesn't deceive me, and it doesn't, there's a green treasure chest somewhere round by here, mun!
Hold up, mun... Is that cave just...a big tree!?
Proper tidy forest, this is.<NL>It's the fairies we've got to thank for that, I reckon!

Well, well! If it isn't the Savior!<NL>It really has been a terribly long time...
Look, Mr. Drippy!<NL>It's that gentleman's diary!
Never mind that, Ollie-boy!<NL>What about that flipping huge door by there!?
Wow... Sure feels like we've seen this door somewhere before, huh?
Hoo hoo! So you found me, did you, Oliver?<NL>Or do you prefer to be called "The Savior"?
Eh? Who are you, when youer at home, and what d'you want with us?
What do I want? Why, I want you to follow me!<NL>Follow me to a whole new world!
Oh, and you may call me "The Conductor."<NL>In fact, I urge you to! Hee hee!
But... Uh... Mr. Conductor, how do you know who I am?
Haa haa! You're the Savior!<NL>Everyone knows who you are!
Looks like youer a proper celeb now, Ollie-boy!<NL>Quite right too, after all the broken hearts you've been mending!
Oh my, yes! Yes indeed! You have given heart and taken heart in equal measure, saving countless poor souls in the process.
And by restoring balance to all those people's hearts, you've brought peace to this world!
You do know what would have happened if it weren't for you, don't you?
We all know what would have happened, mun!<NL>The whole world would've ended up brokenhearted!
CORRECT—at least in part!<NL>Every weak heart would indeed have been broken...
But answer me this! What would have become of all the strong hearts? The ones that the imbalance favored?
Eh? What are you on about?
Confused, are you? Hoo hoo!<NL>This world is all about balance.
When that balance is lost, "rifts" are formed.<NL>Those brokenhearted people you've been working so hard to help—each harbors a certain type of rift.
But that's not the only type.
So... What other types are there?
Hee hee! I think you'd better see for yourself!
You're about to enter a whole new world.<NL>...You do want to go, don't you? You wish to be enlightened, yes?
Wonderful! Thank you, Oliver!<NL>I have nothing but admiration for your inquisitive spirit!
Too right, mun! Ollie-boy wants to know it all, en't it? Speaking of which... What are we supposed to be doing?
Why, sealing the rifts, of course!
Uh... Sorry, Mr. Conductor...b-but I'm still not sure what these rifts are...
Each one is the nexus of a spectrum of potentiality.<NL>The very definition of a lost soul! Don't you see?
No. I don't have a flipping clue what youer on about.
Haa haa! Fear not, it's probably better not to think about it too much. All you need to know is that these rifts have manifested in this world.
And in the midst of each, there is a terrifying monster!<NL>You surely remember how nightmares afflict the brokenhearted? Well, this is rather similar!
So you want us to wallop some beasties, is it? Well why didn't you flipping say so? Ready, Ollie-boy?
U-Uh...sure!<NL>If you think that'll help...
Oh, thank you so much, Oliver!<NL>You should be able to receive further details about the locations at Swift Solutions.
The world needs its Savior!<NL>I'm counting on you!
I see. I didn't think the Savior would choose to live in blissful ignorance...
Please, Oliver! Won't you seal these rifts for me?
Rifts are formed where the strongest hearts create<NL>an imbalance.
I'm sure you know all about such places, being the Savior, and all.
Oliver! A new rift has been formed!<NL>Would you be a champ and seal it up for me?
Oh dear... You look rather confused. Surely you've worked out what these rifts are by now? Why, you've even seen one for yourself!
You're doing a great job of sealing the rifts, Oliver.
Now, this next rift is one with which you have a very special connection...
It's time... It's time already...<NL>There's only one rift remaining.
It is time to face that which you have faced before...<NL>
Congratulations, Oliver!<NL>All the rifts have been sealed!
'Course they have, mun!<NL>Ollie-boy eats monsters like that for breakfast!
But those monsters...
You'd seen them before, hadn't you?
Uh...
But they're really not the same as the ones you fought before. Truth be told, they're not even of this world!
Which is why they've attracted the attention of the Guardian of Worlds...
The Guardian of Worlds?
He's the one who controls this world. And your world. And every world, in fact!
If there are monsters from another world turning up in the rifts in this one... Well, he's not going to turn a blind eye to that!
That's why I kept this door shut, you see.<NL>I didn't want him to get involved...
So the Guardian of Worlds is behind this door?
That's right. This is the door to the Grand Confluence, where all worlds meet, and souls are wont to gather...
It is also home to the recently awoken Guardian of Worlds.<NL>
Okay, got that. So...if this Guardian of the Worlds fellow has woken up...what'll happen, exactly?
Oh! No, no, no, no, it's not that! Nothing bad will happen! The Guardian and the worlds he controls are one and the same, you see.
Hang on a minute...
(sigh) What lies behind that door exists only to satisfy your curiosity.
I very much doubt your actions in there will have any consequences...although they might. As might doing nothing...
I just don't know.
I suppose the question is, Oliver:<NL>are you curious?
If you are, I'll open the door for you.
The question is, Oliver: are you curious?
Wonderful, Oliver!<NL>You really are the Savior!
But the guardian...<NL>We made him disappear...
No need to worry. As I told you, the Guardian of Worlds is the world itself. They are one and the same.
Nothing you can do could ever make it "disappear." Likewise, nothing it can do could ever do the same to you!
I just have not got a single clue what is going on here.<NL>I don't even know why we fought that thing in the<NL>first place!
You don't know why? But I thought you said you<NL>were curious? And now your curiosity is sated.<NL>Isn't that enough?
You are the Savior—blessed with the most precious virtue of all!
Huh? What do you mean?
You have restored numerous virtues to people's hearts.
Enthusiasm, kindness, courage, restraint, belief, confidence, love, ambition—even humor...
All of these are indispensable...
But they are not enough to save the world.<NL>Something else is required...
And you have it. It glows within your heart.<NL>A deep, warm glow that—
FLIPPING HECK, MUN! Will you just get to the point!?
Hoo hoo! Impatient I see...<NL>Very well. The virtue required to save this world is...
Curiosity.
...Eh!? What's that supposed to mean!?
Exactly! What, who, why, where! Curiosity is the virtue that compels one to seek answers—to explore the boundaries of one's own world, and discover the next!
I... I think I understand.
I started out on this journey because I wanted to save my mom. Because I wanted to see her again...
But even though I couldn't do that—just being here, seeing all these new things, and meeting all these great people... It's really been something...
I mean, sure, it's been tough at times, and I've felt<NL>sad, but...
Yes?
It sure has been an awful lot of fun!
CORRECT!<NL>That's the answer I was waiting for!
But you know, your adventure isn't over yet.<NL>There's still something you need to do, isn't there?
...Yes. There is.
But you don't need to do it right now! No! I've prepared a little treat for you, instead—seeing as you've made it this far!
Go ahead, open the next door!
This is where the fun really begins, Oliver!<NL>Go ahead, open the next door!
Well, well! Oliver the Savior...<NL>It's a pleasure to see you again!
Don't look now, but there's a proper weird-looking bloke over there. I'd steer well clear if I were you, mun.
Where did this forest come from, anyway? Did it used to be by here? I don't remember it. Something funny's going on, mun...
Crikey, look at that massive great big gate! Reminds me of something, it does...
I don't know if you've realized, Ollie-boy, but this place by here is the exact center of ouer world...
Being in a place of awe and majesty reminds me of when they started calling me Lord High Lord of the Fairies. Ahh, my proudest moment...

You do remember how to read youer Wizard's Companion, don't you, Ollie-boy?
Sure I do, Mr. Drippy! I just open it up from the <color:#1>Main Menu</color> and, uh...start reading!
Exactly! A budding wizard like you should be reading a bit of that book every day, truth be told. Anyway, get and find them magic words, will you? We haven't got all day!

I hope to see you here in Castaway Cove again soon, young man—wearing your bathing suit, of course!
Hang on a minute, mun!<NL>Youer hopping on board right now!?

Going to sea's not something to be taken lightly, you know. Just ask my Uncle Dai!

Gee... I guess you're right...
Ho ho! Rarely have I seen travelers look so at home in their bathing suits!
Ho ho! Bathing suits suit you, my friends!<NL>Truly they do!
I will be pleased and honored if you are so kind as to wear them again.
Should the Cowlipha see fit to grant you permission to board, I will refuse you nothing! Sadly for you, Her Moojesty does not bestow such favors lightly! Ha ha!
Once again it is he!<NL>That blasted thief!
Please, this pot is a gift to you.<NL>I wish for you to accept it, without reservation.
Ah! You will be glad to hear that I am able to offer my wares for sale once more. Please, feel free to peruse.

Well, I am sure you need not concern yourself with such matters. Please, peruse my wares!
A thousand thank yous for your patronage.<NL>I hope to see you again soon.
Damn it! If I can't get on that ship, I might as well tear these useless pieces of paper to shreds!
Welcome to Castaway Cove!<NL>I hope your visit is blessed with sunshine and fine tides!
Phew... It is accursedly hot today, I think. Perhaps I should swim out to the edge of the cove. It may be somewhat cooler there.
Father told me that when he lived in a city named Hamelin, he had to wear heavy armor at all times.
Now that he has moved to Castaway Cove, he has no need for such things. He keeps them under the bed, alongside his periodicals.
Men of the sea must not whine and complain.<NL>They must be strong and steadfast.
But goodness, it is hot...
This is a desert bloom whose flowers open only during the evening! It is said to be exceptionally rare!
And yet...it is daytime, and the flower is open...<NL>By the beards of the Ancients, it is a facsimile!
The peddler on the way into town sells all manner of curios.
I cannot help but wonder where he obtains them...
I trust the sea is in fine spirits today, Father?
I recently saw a stranger walking through town.<NL>He was not a traveler, I think. He did not have enough luggage.
A friend of yours, perhaps?
Two bunches of babanas and a nice crispy lettuce. That should make for a hearty meal!
You are not a sailor, I think.<NL>Your skin is pale as a dumpty egg!
Yesterday, Father caught the largest dumbflounder he had ever seen! ...But it got away.
Father... What is a long-sleeved shirt?
Father said he would teach me how to catch a colossal squid! Just as soon as I get a little older...
Mother's latest glowshrimp haul has broken the all-Mamooni record!
You are from outside of here, I think...<NL>Please tell me about long-sleeved shirts! Are they very uncomfortable?
With the blessings of the Ancients, I shall return with a basket full of glowshrimp!
Ah, there is no place like one's hometown.
Welcome to Castaway Cove, travelers!<NL>You are fond of our town, perhaps?
It is, I think, a very nice way of life we have here. You should stay for a while.
My uncle is the greatest sailor Castaway Cove has ever seen! He taught Captain Sindbah all that he knows!
It is glowshrimp season, you know.<NL>At this time, they are at their most plump and plentiful!
It pleases me to see you so full of courage...<NL>But still, you must remain cautious, I think.
Ahh, what perfect weather! I can only hope that the Ancients bless us further with a still sea and a bounteous catch!<NL>
Today, I shall return with a mighty haul, Ancients willing!
Fresh fruits! Vibrant vegetables!<NL>The finest in all the Summerlands!
You came from Ding Dong Dell, perhaps?<NL>I hear that it is a fine city—if a little dull.

So we're planning on turning this milk by here into cheese, is it? I'll bet my lantern you've got just the spell to do it, too!
Good day to you all.<NL>How may I be of service?
We brought some cheese to give to the Cowlipha, Mr. Abull, Sir!
Ch-Cheese!? Praise be to the Ancients! I had thought there was none remaining in all the land!
The Cowlipha just can't get enough of it, huh?
Hm!? How did you hear of this? It is a secret known only to those within the palace!
...No matter. You are correct. Her Moojesty is indeed a great admirer of cheese in its many forms.
She will undoubtedly grant an audience to any who come bearing such a gift.
Please, you must follow me.<NL>Quickly!
Hello! Hoo can I help you today? Have you tried mixing babanas with milk and yogurt? It's a hooge favorite here in Al Mamoon!
Uh, sorry to change the subject, Ma'am, but could I ask you something?
Can you think of anybody here in town who has a lot of <color:#1>restraint</color>?
Hoo hoo! That's a strange question! But I'll hoomor you, dear. Why, all the people of the desert have plenty of restraint—they need it to stay out in the scorching sun!
Hmph. I s'pose she's got a point there. Don't help us much, though, does it? Let's see if someone else can narrow it down a bit, shall we?
Sure, Mr. Drippy.<NL>Thank you, Ma'am!
How do, Mister? We're in the market for a person with more <color:#1>restraint</color> than a magpie in a jewelry shop. Anyone spring to mind?
...You're what? Oh, you mean you're looking for someone who can swallow their urges and stand firm in the face of temptation?
Hmm, if you were looking for someone who couldn't control their desires, I could tell you pretty swiftly.
Honestly, some of the requests she sends winging my way from the palace... Ahem! Sorry, that was indiscreet of me.
There's disappointing... I thought if there was one place we could go for red-hot info, it would be by here. Never mind. Sorry to bother you, Birdface!
Thanks, Mister!
Oh, it's you again! What a surpurrise!<NL>I'm ever so sorry about the other day...
Oh, uh, that's okay.<NL>I actually came here to ask you something...
<color:#1>Restraint</color>, you say?<NL>Purrhaps...
Of course! The sauna here is hot enough to test anyone's <color:#1>restraint</color> to the limit! It would be the purrfect place to find the purrson you're looking for!
Shall I book you in?<NL>Let me just purruse the bookings a moment...
Flip, mun—she can't half turn a quick question into a fast buck! Maybe we can try it in a bit, but we'd best keep looking for the minute.
Sure. We should try the other stores first.
Caw, you rook troubled! Well, if it's equipment tough enough to survive the harsh desert environment you're after, you've come to the right place!
Uh, actually, we came to ask you something. We need to find somebody with a lot of <color:#1>restraint</color>, but nobody seems to know a person like that...
You must be rooking in all the wrong places!<NL>Unless I'm raven mad, I know just the person!
Oh you do, do you?
Who is it?<NL>Please, you have to tell us!
Abull, of cawse! If I had his patience, I'd be crowing about it all over town!
Abull...?
That's right. A little bird told me quite a story about him... It was a few years ago now...
One day, the Cowlipha decided out of the blue that she wouldn't beak content until she had tasted all the cheeses in the world...
Cheese?<NL>I guess she really is just like Miss Leila, huh?
Without a moment's hesitation, Abull set off to rook for them all.
Through forests and across oceans he went, battered by blizzards, and often surviving on little more than a wing and a prayer...
But finally, he came home to roost. And when he did, it was with a cart piled high with every cheese under the sun! Caw blimey—it must have stank!
Now that's what I cawl <color:#1>restraint</color>! And by goodness does he need it, with Her Moojesty crowing on at him all the time!
Crikey, there's impressive! He did all that—risked his life and everything—just so Her Moossiveness could have a snack?
Tidy!<NL>I think we've found ouer man, Ollie-boy!
Neato!<NL>We should go find him right away!
Mr. Abull, Sir! We found out about somebody with a whole lot of <color:#1>restraint</color>!
You did? This is excellent news.<NL>You must tell me—who is it?
It's you!
Me? But—<NL>Impossible!
Not in the slightest, Peter Patience!<NL>Look at Ollie-boy's Locket—it's glowing up a treat!
Would you let us borrow some of your <color:#1>restraint</color>, Mr. Abull?
Hm? Well, I... Of course you may.<NL>For Her Moojesty, anything...
What must I do?
There's nothing to it!<NL>Just lie back and think of Al Mamoon...
Well?<NL>Get on with it, Ollie-boy!
Sure!<NL>Here goes...
For Her Moojesty, anything...
Tidy!<NL>All done!
Already? And this is truly enough to restore Her Moojesty to her former glory?
You bet it is!
Mmmmmm! Cheesy-weese!<NL>Mountains of delicious cheesy-weese!
And all for us!<NL>Mmmnomnomnomnomnom...
She's got cheese on the flipping brain, her! Even dreams about the stuff! Quick, Ollie-boy, magic her better,<NL>will you?
Yes, Sir!
Hm? No more cheese?<NL>What is the meaning of this!?<NL>We must have more! Mooore!!!
Knickers... Quick, Ollie-boy! Hand over that <color:#1>restraint</color> before she scoffs us on the off chance we're made of<NL>you-know-what!
Can Her Moojesty truly be restored to her former self?
There is a Great Sage somewhere in the city of Hamelin, far to the east.
You must find this sage.<NL>And I must investigate Shadar's activities further...
By the beards of the Ancients! For the very Cowlipha Herself to become brokenhearted...
I had heard the unfortunate rumors, of course, yet for them to prove true is... But wait—how were you able to gain admittance to the palace?
Cheeeeeeeeese!<NL>We need more cheesy-weese!<NL>Moooooore! This instant!
Though I say it myself, I believe I may have created something of surpassing beauty...
Welcome, welcome!<NL>All of our produce is the very freshest!
You are visitors to our city, are you not?<NL>Then I shall give you a most magnificent discount!
(sigh) If people would only clean up after themselves...<NL>This area is awash with spilled milk... And in this heat!<NL>Oh dear me...
Do you like what you see? It is of the highest quality, of course! Fresh from the southern port of Castaway Cove!
Your clothes are most...unique, stranger.<NL>Are you not terribly hot?
Have you come to try our delicious babanas, friend? If you have not tried them, you must! They are truly a wonder!
Esther is back to her usual wonderful self!<NL>Praise be to the Ancients!
My hair is in fact of darkest black, but the relentless sunshine of our land has turned it a rich brown.
It is not fair!<NL>Why can I not have another babana split?
And a chocolate-coated babana!
Praise the Ancients!<NL>Milk! Delicious milk!
Welcome, welcome, to Al Mamoooooon!<NL>The Cowlipha is larger than a great sand duuune!
I will be a most famous writer of songs when I am older. You must come to all of my performances!
My, this is a most beautiful color...<NL>That decides it! I will purchase this also!
Oh, how annoying! I traveled all the way here from Castaway Cove to get a deeper tan, and now I'm burned to a crisp! It stings like mad!
Why didn't anyone tell me it was this hot?<NL>It's an outrage!
The oasis on which our city relies has begun to dwindle of late.
We must learn to conserve water, or suffer the consequences...
Ohhh... Oh my...it's hot...<NL>But I think I might be starting to get used to it.
Yes. Maybe I'll stay just a little longer...
We are blessed with yet another blistering day!<NL>The sweat, it pours from me like a mighty river!
If it grows much hotter, the milk of the fountains will curdle.
...A-ha! This gives me an idea!<NL>I shall fill bottles with water, and sell those!<NL>I will surely become most rich!
I am afraid that I cannot allow you to pass.<NL>It is not currently permitted.
Master Abull has granted you permission to enter. Please, feel free to proceed.
If you wish an audience with Her Moojesty, you must obtain Master Abull's permission.
You are here to see Her Moojesty. Master Abull told us to expect you. Please, the Cowlipha must be treated with the utmost reverence.
Milk! Milk! Get the coolest, freshest milk in all the city! Fresher than that of any other merchant!
This fabric is most light and cool! Feel it! Our stock is supplied by the Cawtermaster's Store—all is entirely aboveboard and approved!
Without the oasis, those who travel the desert would surely perish.
This is why it is sacred to the people of our fair city.
In such ferocious heat, one wishes to bathe oneself most frequently. We are fortunate to have the spa at our disposal. Praise the Ancients!
By the Ancients, what a handsome young man! We are blessed! Please do not hesitate to tell me if any of our wares catch your eye!
The Taskmaster of the Swift Solutions store is most handsome, yes? In my day, he would have been inundated with offers of marriage!
It is most ferociously hot again today. I am of course accustomed to the heat, but a traveler such as yourself must find it unbearable.
Very well, dearest. I cannot bear to see you unhappy. You shall have all that you wish for...
That young seller of fabrics is a most fierce salesperson. The girls of Al Mamoon are not to be trifled with!
Ho ho ho! There is none more spoiled than our beloved grandchild!
Haa... Haa...
I will soon compete in the Oasis Race!<NL>I must practice all that I can, or I shall not win!
My father sails all over the world aboard the merchant ships of Castaway Cove. He tells me that the export of babanas is a most profitable trade.
I hope that one day we will sail the seas together.
Al Mamoon offers you its most humble of welcomes.
You must enjoy your fill of our delicious and renowned babanas, and our cool and refreshing milk!
I am the greatest fan of milk in all the land! That is why this town will be my home for ever and ever!
People say that the Cowlipha is a most enormous personage...
(sigh) I am so very jealous... Excuse me? You say that this is not a thing to be jealous of? But whyever not?
I like to play here by the fountain.<NL>It is a cool and shaded place.
Husband! Why do you not listen to me!?
Again you have purchased goods that we cannot possibly sell!

I hear that you healed Her Moojesty's heart.<NL>Hm. Most impressive, young wizard.
At last, your way to Hamelin and the next Great Sage is clear. The journey before you will be long and arduous. Prepare yourselves.
I came across a most intriguing fact while researching Shadar's activities.
Only the guardians of those places that you have visited have become crazed.
Can this really be a coincidence? It seems more likely that it is the work of a nefarious force.
So Shadar's corruption had spread even as far as the heart of the Sage of Hamelin...
But why does he take only our hearts? Why not our lives also? There must be a reason for this...
In the days of the Ancients, our world was abundant with kingdoms governed by the power of wizardry.
Tales of those times live on, both here and elsewhere. When Esther was young, I told them to her often...
Shadar hides himself away in the far north of the continent of Autumnia, beyond a fetid swamp cloaked in a foul miasma.
Sadly, the one instrument capable of lifting this pall lives now only in legend...
Hm? The Clarion lives again?<NL>So the three kingdoms act as one once more...
Of course... The masters of all three owe you their lives. Only this could have convinced them to work together again.
So the Great Sage Alicia and your mother were one and the same...
"The one who heals the brokenhearted...<NL>The savior of this world of sadness..."
She often spoke of such a one.<NL>Who could have known that it would be you...?
We feel as if we have awoken from a sluggish slumber! Next time you see us, we will be as slim as we were in our youth! And twice as beautiful!
If you come across the handsome young sage from the picture, do give him our...warmest regards. Tee hee hee!
We had reserved one of the milk fountains in the square entirely for our own consumption, but we have now decreed that both be opened to all.
Of late, we have been having strange dreams of running around a most peculiar-looking town. Our inner self must be telling us to exercise...
The town in our dream is almost...otherworldly.<NL>We can only speculate as to where it might be...
Our fair city may be a verdant oasis, ripe with babanas nowadays, but in times past, not so much as a single tree stood here.
It was our ancestors' ingenuity that gave rise to what you see today. Every leaf is a testament to their wizardry. No ordinary plant could flourish in such arid climes.
It is from a tree the Ancients brought into being that the holy wood you see before you was cut.
We had yet another strange dream. You were in it, boy... Locked in a strange room, and looking most upset...
We tried our hardest to encourage you to overcome your hardships.
Well? Did our words of support reach you?<NL>We do so, so hope so...
So it was not a dream? We really were transformed into a monstrous moocow?
We seem to remember charging about the place most vigorously, but we are not one bit slimmer. We are not amused!
We were most pleased that the sky floaty-woaty had joined us in our fight, but we rather worried that we were too...generously proportioned for it.
Therefore, we left Abull in charge of our flying forces, and retook our place amongst our beloved subjects.
But fear not—we shall be sending plenty of dashing young men on broomy-wooms to join in the fight. We do hope they prove useful.
My, my, my... Is it our imagination, or has the Sage of Hamelin grown even more gallant and handsome of late? Mmm, we could just gobble him up!
Praise be to the Ancients! Her Moojesty walks once more! Now that she stands, I see just how...magnificently proportioned she has grown.
With the letter of passage, the Sea Cow is yours to command. May the Ancients watch over you on the waves.
Are you familiar with the curry stand in front of the palace? Its delicious aroma reaches even into the depths of the palace to tempt us.
Her Moojesty once dined from dawn until dusk without pause, and yet now, she partakes of a mere three meals a day, and scarcely a crumb at afternoon tea...
(sigh) On occasion, I find myself looking back on the days of her glorious excess with a certain...fondness.
The holy wood is cut from a most precious tree, the secret of whose miraculous growth is passed from generation to generation of Mamooni royalty.
The piece in your possession was grown by our most green-fingered Moojesty herself in her younger days.
I pray that soon the three kingdoms will join together in peaceful cooperation, just as they have joined forces to resurrect the Clarion.
I am most surprised. There is not a single injury among the people of the city who were...transformed.
Whatever happened to us all...?
Though I say it myself, I believe I may have created something of surpassing beauty...
Welcome, welcome!<NL>All of our produce is the very freshest!
You are visitors to our city, are you not?<NL>Then I shall give you a most magnificent discount!
You are visitors to our city, are you not? You must purchase a memento of your stay—we also stock the finest handcrafted souvenirs!
(sigh) If people would only clean up after themselves...<NL>This area is awash with spilled milk... And in this heat!<NL>Oh dear me...
The ground is so thick with spilt milk that my shoes are sticking as I walk. Ugh...
Do you like what you see? It is of the highest quality, of course! Fresh from the southern port of Castaway Cove!
Your clothes are most...unique, stranger.<NL>Are you not terribly hot?
I will not allow a single drop of milk to pass my lips until my training is completed. Not a drop!
The Oasis Race will be more draining even than this. I must be strong. Nnnnnnnnngh...
Noooooooooooo!!!<NL>I drank it! I drank the milk!
And I had promised myself I would not!<NL>Curse my lack of restraint!
Esther is back to her usual wonderful self!<NL>Praise be to the Ancients!
Might you persuade Esther to sing for us again soon?<NL>It has been so long!
My hair is in fact of darkest black, but the relentless sunshine of our land has turned it a rich brown.
My mother begs me to wear my hat lower upon my head.
But I like my new brown hair! Why does she not understand that I wish to keep it so?
It is not fair!<NL>Why can I not have another babana split?
And a chocolate-coated babana!
It is not fair!<NL>Why can I not have another deluxe babana split?
And a double-chocolate-coated babana!
Praise the Ancients!<NL>Milk! Delicious milk!
Welcome, welcome, to Al Mamoooooon!<NL>The Cowlipha is larger than a great sand duuune!
I will be a most famous writer of songs when I am older. You must come to all of my performances!
Welcome, welcome, to Al Mamoooooon!<NL>The desert town among the duuuuuunes!
My, this is a most beautiful color...<NL>That decides it! I will purchase this also!
Oh, how annoying! I traveled all the way here from Castaway Cove to get a deeper tan, and now I'm burned to a crisp! It stings like mad!
Why didn't anyone tell me it was this hot?<NL>It's an outrage!
Phew... It's so hot... I think a visit to the spa is in order...and perhaps a babana split.
The oasis on which our city relies has begun to dwindle of late.
We must learn to conserve water, or suffer the consequences...
We are forced to rely too heavily upon the water of the oasis.
I often pray to the Ancients that we will be blessed with more rain. Even snow would not be unwelcome...
Ohhh... Oh my...it's hot...<NL>But I think I might be starting to get used to it.
Yes. Maybe I'll stay just a little longer...
I'm getting pretty used to the heat around here now. I think I might even be starting to enjoy sweating so much...
Ha! Listen to me! I'll be talking like one of the locals next!
We are blessed with yet another blistering day!<NL>The sweat, it pours from me like a mighty river!
Such a shame. Earlier, it was cool, but it is now most uncomfortably hot again...
If it grows much hotter, the milk of the fountains will curdle.
...A-ha! This gives me an idea!<NL>I shall fill bottles with water, and sell those!<NL>I will surely become most rich!
I drank too much milk, and dreamed that I was a cow!
In my dream, I won the hand of the Cowlipha, and we were wed! It was most pleasant...
The smell of most delicious cuisine wafts from the palace, does it not? Ho ho! Her Moojesty is a highly refined gourmand!
I am sometimes lucky enough to receive the scraps of her meals from the kitchen. They are a feast in themselves!
Ohh, I am so terribly hungry...<NL>Will mealtime never come?
Welcome to the glorious palace of Al Mamoon. You wish to see the Cowlipha, yes? Please, she must be treated with the utmost reverence.
The shift of my colleague here will soon be at an end, so he thinks only of mealtime. Such frivolity!
I have not forgotten the importance of my sworn duties like some I could mention, but I must admit to having grown painfully hungry...
Milk! Milk! Get the coolest, freshest milk in all the city! Fresher than that of any other merchant!
Get the coolest babana juice in all the city!<NL>Fresher than that of any other merchant!
This fabric is most light and cool! Feel it! Our stock is supplied by the Cawtermaster's Store—all is entirely aboveboard and approved!
Shop here for the fluffiest and most absorbent towels in all the land! If you plan to visit Al Mamoon's renowned spa, you must not be without one!
Without the oasis, those who travel the desert would surely perish.
This is why it is sacred to the people of our fair city.
I am sure I remember seeing snow falling here not so long ago... But I must be imagining things.
Snow cannot fall in the desert, after all...
In such ferocious heat, one wishes to bathe oneself most frequently. We are fortunate to have the spa at our disposal. Praise the Ancients!
I greatly enjoy splashing and playing in the waters of the spa as I did in my childhood!
By the Ancients, what a handsome young man! We are blessed! Please do not hesitate to tell me if any of our wares catch your eye!
The Taskmaster of the Swift Solutions store is most handsome, yes? In my day, he would have been inundated with offers of marriage!
Surely a person who could cool the milk of the fountains would become richer still?
The silly fool was moaning, "Lowlah, Lowlah! I love you!"
Such a strange dream for a grown man to have...
Very well, dearest. I cannot bear to see you unhappy. You shall have all that you wish for...
That young seller of fabrics is a most fierce salesperson. The girls of Al Mamoon are not to be trifled with!
Ho ho ho! There is none more spoiled than our beloved grandchild!
I sometimes worry that she may have become a little greedy...
Haa... Haa...
I will soon compete in the Oasis Race!<NL>I must practice all that I can, or I shall not win!
I drank too much milk.
I can feel it slosh from side to side inside me as I run...
My father sails all over the world aboard the merchant ships of Castaway Cove. He tells me that the export of babanas is a most profitable trade.
I hope that one day we will sail the seas together.
Did the same snow that fell before fall wherever my father is now?
It was most beautiful, but I am sure it led to something bad... I wonder why I cannot remember what it was...
Al Mamoon offers you its most humble of welcomes.
You must enjoy your fill of our delicious and renowned babanas, and our cool and refreshing milk!
I beg your pardon...? Hm? Milk? Around my mouth? Oh, the shame! You must accept my humblest apologies!
I am the greatest fan of milk in all the land! That is why this town will be my home for ever and ever!
People say that the Cowlipha is a most enormous personage...
(sigh) I am so very jealous... Excuse me?<NL>You say that this is not a thing to be jealous of?<NL>But whyever not?
People say that the Cowlipha is a most powerful personage...
(sigh) I am so very jealous... I am sure she knows the greatest of fighting maneuvers...
I like to play here by the fountain.<NL>It is a cool and shaded place.
I like to play here by the fountain. It is a cool and shaded place—when compared to the rest of the city, at least!
None shall prevent me from diving in and cooling myself down!
Husband! Why do you not listen to me!?
Again you have purchased goods that we cannot possibly sell!
Praise be to the Ancients for sending you to help us! My husband would surely have driven us to ruin!

The sea is beautiful today, is it not?<NL>It is the gentle ocean breeze that makes life in Castaway Cove such a pleasure!
Phew... It is accursedly hot today, I think. Perhaps I should swim out to the edge of the cove. It may be somewhat cooler there.
Ha ha! Father has adapted well to life in Castaway Cove. The other day, he caught a fish that was almost bigger than me!
Men of the sea must not whine and complain.<NL>They must be strong and steadfast.
But goodness, it is hot...
Hmm... Could that necklace truly be made from flakes of "snoh"...?
Perhaps I should buy it...<NL>Or perhaps not... I simply cannot decide!
We are rather liberated here in Castaway Cove, are we not? People are not so open-minded in other towns, I think...
I have always thought the sea to be similar to a child.<NL>One moment it is calm and pleasant...
But the next, it starts to rage most viciously.<NL>You would do well to be watchful, I think.
Why do you stare at me so?<NL>You are not used to seeing people carry baskets on their heads, perhaps?
You are clearly not from these parts!<NL>This is the only method of keeping one's possessions dry while swimming!
Another ship laden with fresh produce came into harbor this morning. The larders of Castaway Cove will always be well-stocked, I think!
My father is a mighty sailor!<NL>You are impressed, I see!
One day, I too shall follow him onto the ocean wave!
A sailor's standing is judged by the depth of his tan...
And you are pale as Mamooni milk!<NL>You should spend more time on deck, I think...
Oh! Did you see it!?<NL>The fish that just swam beneath the deck... It was enormous!
(sniff) Father scolded me today.<NL>He told me I could not catch a fish even if it were placed in my hand, ready-wrapped in a babana leaf! (sob)
My tan is much deeper than yours!<NL>This can only mean that I am a mightier sailor!
Captain Sindbah has such bronzed skin...<NL>That is the kind of husband I should like to have one day!
It is time to head out to sea once more.<NL>A great haul lies in store for me today, I am sure of it!
Ah, there is no place like one's hometown.
I have lived here in Castaway Cove for over forty years now...
I have seen many people come and go, and many things change. Not always did we wear bathing suits, you know! ...Yet the sea remains unchanging.
Are you coping with the heat, young man?
Perhaps a brief swim would prove beneficial.<NL>It would cool you down, I am sure.
Be careful, please. I shall prepare your favorite dish for when you return.
It pleases me to see you so full of courage...<NL>But still, you must remain cautious, I think.
The sea appears to be in high spirits today.<NL>I feel the Ancients will grant me a bounteous haul!
Today, I shall return with a mighty haul, Ancients willing!
Fresh fruits! Vibrant vegetables!<NL>The finest in all the Summerlands!
You came from Ding Dong Dell, perhaps?<NL>I heard that it is a fine city—if a little dull.
Ho ho! It pleases me to see you wearing your bathing suits once more!
They do suit you, my friends.<NL>Truly they do!

Counting on you, I am, bach!
If you fancy seeing a bit of fairy comedy how it's s'posed to be done, get youerself over to the Cavity Club. It's just down the way there.
A stunning example of ancient fairy architecture, it is... Give or take all the bits they replaced the other week... Which was most of them...
Crikey! Humans! There's unusual! What's that red thingy on youer back? Makes you fly, does it?
There's a pair of comedians round by here used to be the funniest in the forest. Smiley 'n' Surly, they're called.
Trouble is, they've got proper rubbish lately.<NL>Embarrassing to watch, it is.
HO HO HO HOOOOOO!!!<NL>What d'you reckon? I'm practicing my sidekick-style hilarious laughing, see? Not bad, is it?
Folks round these parts flipping love a bit of gossip. Soon as something happens, it's round the forest like wildfire.
Crikey! Massive, you are! Human, is it?<NL>What do I have to eat to get as big as you?<NL>Come on, tell me youer secret!
That trio of comedians over by there is the Three Twins. There's a big one called Tiny, a thin one called Fatty, and the leader's old Bossy, en't it?
Proper—ha ha ha—funny, they are! I'm—hee hee HEE—cracking up just—ho ho ho ho—talking about them! Hmhmhmhmhm!
Bossy-boy's looking minuscule as ever today!<NL>A proper midget, he is! I can't even see him behind that flipping mic stand!
If you ask me, the thing every comedy duo needs is a nice, thick sidekick. The stupider the better!
Crikey, the sauce by here is proper tasty!<NL>I wonder what they puts in it. Mmm...
Nice to see you...
...Gah, youer s'posed to say "to see you, nice," en't it! Flip, mun! Can't get the blooming sidekicks these days...
Aww, there's lovely! A little human boy, come to visit us! Careful round by here, mind—there's some proper dodgy characters about.
...Mainly me!<NL>Gyuk gyuk gyuk!
I'm no Billy-no-Mates. I just like eating solo, en't it. Helps you really concentrate on the flavors and that. Proper sophisticated, I am, see?
Flip, mun! Why d'you have to whack me so flipping hard!? I'm youer sidekick, not youer flipping punch bag!
You want to sit down, is it? Righto. Wait a sec, I'll just budge up for you—make a bit of room, like... No? Bah, fine. Suit youerself.
That's the stuff, Tiny! All that blubber makes him the perfect sidekick! You can give him a right old comedy whack!
I know the Fairyground's famous for food and funnies mainly, but it's got more to offer than that, you know.
The air round by here's clean as a whistle, and the night sky's enough to blow youer tiny mind!
I eats more than anybody else in this whole forest by here! Keep it coming, chief, I en't nowhere near finished yet!
I reckon if I scrimps on a few ingredients here and there, I can up my profits by a tidy bit... Megabucks, here I come!
...Ahem. Oh, don't mind me, mun. Just practicing my lines for, um...the panto, en't it.
See all these signs on the stalls and shops and that? They're lit up by magic, en't it. You won't see that nowhere else, mun. Unique, it is.
Give over, mun!<NL>I can't eat no more—I'm flipping stuffed!
The harder I wallop you, the louder they'll laugh, en't it? It's pretty flipping funny from where I'm standing! Yuk yuk yuk!
Oh. Visitors, is it?<NL>Tidy! Sit down, sit down!
Let me get you a nice bowl of slug stew or three!
Woohoohoohoohooo! Crikey, mun! I'm wetting myself—these lot are proper flipping hilarious!
Oi! I thought I told you to stop sticking youer fingers in the sauce! We don't know where you've been!
Ahh, there's nothing like getting out of the house and having a bit of me-time away from all my troubles...
And I don't even have none!<NL>Na-ah-ah-ah!
You en't seen the Fairyground till you've seen the great big giant...lady up the end of town. You won't believe youer eyes, mun!
If you ask me, the thing every comedy duo needs is a good, clever straight man. The quicker he is, the better!
Geheheheheheheheheheh!<NL>Them Three Twins are flipping legends, mun!
Travelers, is it? Have fun.<NL>S'nice round by here and that.
What d'you reckon? I'm the official town greeter. Bet I made you feel proper special there, didn't I?
There's not just food stalls round by here, you know.
We got one of them hooty shops, the swift one, the crow one, the whole shebang. Just look at the roof, en't it. The signs'll tell you which one's which.
My do's gone proper bouncy lately.<NL>Reckon it must be that new shampoo I got...
Ha! You thought I didn't see, en't it? You tried to give me a comedy whack and completely missed! What a flipping lemon! Yahaaa!
Zzz... (snort) Nnngh... Zzz...

Hurry up, mun! Youer the only one who can help, and we're in a right old flipping potch...
Hang on a mo, Drippy-boy—is that them <color:#1>pieces of art</color> you got there?
Tid— Oh. It's not? Knickers.
You lot ready to watch Mam wet herself?
Well, let us know when you are, en't it.
It's time for the Smiley 'n' Surly Show!<NL>You ready to watch us split Mam's sides?
Whaaat? Why not? Hurry up, will you!<NL>We're flipping itching to get started!
The stage is set! The lights are lit!<NL>We'll crack her up, you crack on in there, right?
Yeah. What he said.<NL>Let's get to it, shall we?
How do. You all right? I need a <color:#1>piece of art</color> or two, mun. You got any?
Long time no see, Drippy-boy. No pieces of art round by here, mun. En't had much to laugh about lately, see...
How come? What's up?
Well, I got these horns on my head, en't it? And lately, they've got helluva long, and now they're <color:#1>proper heavy</color>. Killing my neck, they are...
Hear that, Ollie-boy? Sounds like a job for a spell-casting superhero such as youer fine young self!
His head's too heavy, en't it? So you need to make it lighter. You know, make it <color:#1>float</color> clean off his shoulders, like...
You need to make him all light-headed, en't it?
Oh, hang on—you en't got the spell I'm thinking of. Someone round by here might do, though. Let's ask around, shall we?
Gah, these flipping horns <color:#1>weigh a ton</color>!<NL>They're doing my neck in!
I reckon you can solve that with a quick spell, Ollie-boy. You must have something that'll work in that<NL>book of youers.
Crikey! It feels like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders! Horns? They feel more like flipping feathers! Light as, they are!
Nice one, Drippy-boy!<NL>Here, have that <color:#1>piece of art</color> you were after...
Tidy!<NL>Ta, mun!
My head feels lighter than if I'd stood up at the speed of sound! Ta, mun! Youer a lifesaver!
Is this place open or what?<NL>HELLO! CUSTOMERS!
Flapping heck, mun!<NL>Drippy-boy, is that you?
'Course it is, you big div. You got any <color:#1>pieces of art</color> handy? We need, oh...I dunno, about eight or so.
Caw, I might have, but I'm a bit busy at the mo. Pressing flowers, I am, see. Well...I would be, only the stone I'm weighing them down with en't flapping heavy enough.
Crikey! We can't let traditional fairy handicrafts like that die out, mun! Don't worry—Ollie-boy here's probably got just the spell to help you!
So what he needs to do is make that flower-pressing stone of his a <color:#1>heck of a lot heavier</color>...
Caw, this flower-pressing stone of mine's well flapping light! It's never going to give me the pressure I need to do these pansies justice!
Oi, Ollie-boy, there's probably a spell for that, eh?
Caw! Heavy as anything, it is now! That'll press my flowers to perfection! This'll give me something to crow about to the boys!
Ta, mun! Youer a proper flapping legend!<NL>Let me see, now...<color:#1>pieces of art</color>, was it? Think there's one knocking about somewhere under here. Let's have a rook...
Oi, Drippy-boy, get a load of these pansies I pressed! Caw, just look! I could stare at their delicate beauty for flapping hours...
'Scuse me, can I have a word, mun?
Hoo hoo! If it isn't the legendary Drippy!<NL>Hoo nice to see hoo!
Stop it, you. Youer making me blush... Listen, you got any <color:#1>pieces of art</color> lying about? You look like the type who might have.
I'm afraid I can't help hoo just now. I've just <color:#1>broken this giant jar</color>, see? Hoo'd have thought I could be so clumsy?
Crikey, there's unfortunate. Youer lucky we stopped by—I reckon my young butty by here can magic it back together for you.
Once a thing's broken, it's broken, en't it?<NL>Unless you can <color:#1>turn back time</color>, that is...
Hoo... I was a hooge fan of that jar, and all. If only there was someone hoo could <color:#1>turn it back to hoo it used to be</color>...
Oi, Ollie-boy! I bet you've got just the spell for the job!
Hoo! Yahooo! It's fixed! There's lovely!
Hoo really have been a hooge help!<NL>Here, this is for hoo!
Ta, mun! Don't mind if I do!<NL>Ta-ra!
Hoo'd have thought hoo could've fixed it!<NL>Hoo really are something else!
Crikey, you still going, are you?
'Course I am, mun! There's life in the old fairy yet!<NL>Can I help you with something, Drippy-boy?
As a matter of fact, you can! Got any <color:#1>pieces of art</color><NL>going begging?
How am I s'posed to know? My cleaner's run off, and I can't find flipping anything! And this floor en't going to <color:#1>sweep itself</color> now, is it?
En't it? I wouldn't be so sure about that...<NL>What d'you reckon, Ollie-boy?
Wizards know more about cleaning than you'd think, what with <color:#1>them things they ride round the sky on</color>...
I got a broom, but I'll be honest with you—I dunno which end's which. I do know this floor en't going to <color:#1>sweep itself</color>, though...
En't it? I wouldn't be so sure about that...<NL>What d'you reckon, Ollie-boy?<NL>I think you know just the spell...
Crikey! Look at that! The broom's up and started moving all on its own! How did that...? Never mind, I en't looking a gift horse in the mouth!
What was it you said you were after, Drippy-boy?<NL><color:#1>Pieces of art</color>, was it? Youer in luck, look—there's one just down by here!
Ha ha! Come to Daddy!<NL>Ta, mun!
That was a tidy little trick you did with my broom earlier on, mun. Pop by and show some more of youer magic sometime, will you?
How do? You open?
Who's that? Oh. How do.<NL>Yeah, they're open, mun. Boring, but open.
All right, Gary Funface. Don't die of enthusiasm. I'll make it quick—anyone by here got any <color:#1>pieces of art</color><NL>we can have?
Pieces of what? Nah. You got any <color:#1>decent food</color> I can have? The stuff they serve by here is rubbish.
That's not very nice, is it? Can't blame you, mind. I've eaten by here... Hang on—Ollie-boy, you can whip something up with youer magic, en't it!
If there en't anything nice to eat by here, we'll just have to <color:#1>make something nice ourselves</color>, en't it?
Flip, mun. <color:#1>Gis something nice to eat</color> for once, will you?
Come on, Ollie-boy, you did this just the other day, en't it? You know how to use youer magic to whip up a quick bite to eat!
Eh? What's this? Om nom nom...<NL>F-F-F-F-F-F...Flip, mun!<NL>This is deeelicious!
You've restored my faith in food! <color:#1>Pieces of art</color>, was it? Here you go. You deserve it!
That'll do nicely!<NL>Don't go stuffing youerself silly now, will you?
Oi, you! Make me that thing you made again, will you? What's that? Too busy to help the likes of me, is it? Charming!
How do, mun.
Meowsers! Drippy-boy! How long's it been?<NL>This is, um...purracticably unheard of!
Blimey. Youer chirpy. Listen—got something to ask you,<NL>I have—you got any <color:#1>pieces of art</color>?
Dunno, mun, I've been <color:#1>feeling the cold</color> so bad lately, I've not had a chance to do much but shiver. It's been, um...purreposterous.
Crikey, mun. Pooer old you. Ollie-boy, do you think we can help the old feller out with a quick spell?
If the old feller's as cold as he says, maybe we should just <color:#1>set him on fire</color>, eh?
I've been <color:#1>feeling the cold</color> something rotten lately! Not even a good joke or a nice hot meal takes the chill off. It's...purrplexing.
Looks like we'd better warm him up quick-smart, eh, Ollie-boy?
Meowwwwwwwww! I'm on flipping fire!<NL>What did you do that for, you purrat!?
Hang about... I en't cold no more. I'm lovely and toasty, in fact! There's...purraiseworthy! Here, is this what you<NL>were after?
That it is! Tidy!<NL>We'll have that!
Meowsers! Drippy! To what do we owe this purreposterous pleasure?
Oi-oi! Can we ask you something quickly?
...Gah, what is it?<NL>...Oh, Drippy-boy. It's you. How do?
Not bad, mun. On youer lonesome as usual, I see. Here, you've not got any <color:#1>pieces of art</color> on you, have you?
I don't have time for that right now, mun.<NL>I can't...get this...nnngh...flipping lid open!
Lid-lock, eh? Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Ollie-boy—got any spells that'll <color:#1>pop this jar open</color> for ouer friend here?
Looks like the lid on that jar's stuck. All <color:#1>locked up</color>, it is. Any thoughts on how we might pop it open, Ollie-boy?
Nnngh... It won't...flipping...open!
Here, Ollie-boy, there's <color:#1>that spell you always use when youer unlocking locks</color>, en't there? Why not give that a try?
Yesss! It's open! Thank flip for that!<NL>Now I can finally have a nice pickled egg!
Ta, mun. ...S'pose I'd best give you something to say thanks, eh? Here.
So you did have one!<NL>Tidy!
Youer Drippy-boy's butty, en't it?<NL>Yeah. I remember you.
Oi, littlie! You got a minute?
Nah, mun, I en't!<NL>I got homework to do, en't it?
Homework? Pah! Pull the other one! Listen, you got any <color:#1>pieces of art</color> spare?
Nah, mun, I en't, mun! And I have got homework, honest! I'm s'posed to grow these seeds by here, but <color:#1>they en't so much as sprouted</color>!
Not sprouted, eh? Looks like they need a bit of a helping hand. You got anything up youer sleeve that might do the trick, Ollie-boy?
If you could <color:#1>make them seeds sprout up just like that</color>, I bet ouer little friend by here would be proper grateful.
Flip, mun, I got to finish my flipping homework, mun! Oi, you! You en't got <color:#1>a way of making these seeds by here grow proper quick</color>, have you?
I think you might, Ollie-boy. You know, the one we used back when... You know!
...Flip, mun! Look at that, mun!<NL>Flew up, they did! 'Mazing!
That's my homework done, mun! Tidy! Ta, mun! You've saved me a right earbashing off Mam! <color:#1>Pieces of art</color>, was it? Here. Ta!
Ta to you too, littlie! Try and do youer own homework next time though, eh?
Wish I had youer magic... I could do some proper funny naughty stuff with it... Heheheheheh!
Tidy! That's a full complement of eight <color:#1>pieces of art</color> we've put together!
Let's get this care package over to Smiley 'n' Surly and bring the light of laughter back into their miserable lives!
They're probably still moping around down by the<NL><color:#1>Cavity Club</color>. Let's get back there, shall we?
You mean the place with the big outdoor stage?<NL>Sure! Let's go!
You got to help us out, Drippy-boy!<NL>We'll have to split up otherwise!
Flip, mun, I'm bursting with...with...with I don't know what. It's proper good though, whatever it is!
Stop going on about us flipping calling it quits, mun!
What's all the racket down by there, hm? What's that? Eh? Pieces of art? To make Smiley 'n' Surly funny again? Sorry, bach—can't help you!
Come on, then!<NL>Give us a proper old laugh, there's good boys!
Counting on you, I am, bach!
Saw Smiley 'n' Surly's show, did you? It's a crying shame they've got so unfunny. Used to make me roll about laughing, they did...
So you've met Mam, then!<NL>...What's that? How do I know?
It's all over the Fairyground, en't it!<NL>News travels proper fast round these parts!
If you ask me, it's Surly's fault him and Smiley have gone down the pan.
He can't set the lines up quick enough, so pooer old Smiley's getting hung out to dry!
Righto, partner of mine!<NL>It's time to rehearse ouer groundbreaking new act!
...Just as soon as you've finished stuffing youer flipping great fat face!
WALLOP!
Oi! Youer s'posed to go "Ow!" and fall over all funny, like! Flip, mun! Can't get the blooming sidekicks these days...
Smiley 'n' Surly are flipping rubbish these days!<NL>And we're all losing custom off the back of it!
I reckon a dwt of a human like you could do better than that pair of layabouts. Actually, that would be proper funny! Gyuk gyuk gyuk!
Not all of us fairies are nice blokes, you know.
Some of us are proper nasty pieces of work.<NL>Take me, for example. Terrifying, en't I?
Oi! What the flip are you doing whacking me when I'm not ready, mun!?
Word around town is, youer helping Smiley 'n' Surly out.
Got nothing better to do than run errands for a pair of has-beens, is it?
We're more than happy for you to enjoy ouer beautiful hometown, but we ask that you take all litter with you when you leave. Ta.
Who? Smiley 'n' Shirley?
Sorry, never heard of them. I don't watch comedy, mun. Takes up too much eating time, en't it?
"Roll up, roll up! Get youer tickets for the Grand Tour of Mam by here!" ...Yep. Reckon that'll go down a treat when I sets it up, mun! Megabucks!
I love the atmosphere of all these stalls and shops all close together. Proper exciting, it is! Makes you wonder what you'll find in there...
Give over, mun!<NL>I'm fit to flipping burst here!
Shut up, mun, you always look ready to be whacked, en't it? You just got one of them faces! Yuk yuk yuk!
Youer kidding, en't you?<NL>We're only just getting started!
Waiter! Two extra-large slices of spider pie!
Oh yeah, mun, a proper catch, she was...<NL>You should have seen the lips on her...<NL>And those eyes...oh, you could drown in them...
...Freshest fish I ever ate!
Everyone's saying Smiley 'n' Surly've lost it, but I think they're proper funny still.
When they just stand there floundering like a pair of plonkers, it cracks me up, mun! Na-ah-ah-ah!
Becoming a comedian is every fairy's dream. That's why we works ouer socks off at being hilarious every minute of every day.
If you ask me, it's Smiley's fault him and Surly have gone down the pan.
Surly sets up a cracking line, and he just stands there like a fairy-shaped rock! Ruining it, he is!
We fairies may talk rough, but we got hearts of gold, en't it? Not literally, mind you. Wouldn't want you trying to dig mine out or nothing...
Pieces of art, you say?<NL>Ask around, en't it.
There's bound to be a few folks with some to spare.
What d'you reckon to my do? Not bad, eh?<NL>It don't come without a bit of hard work, mind. Down the salon every day, I am.
Zzz... What, mun...? Whaaat?<NL>Nngh... Zzz...

The Fairy Godmother's laughing! Hurry up and jump down her throat!

pla-e_050_010-t12_npc_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tidy! She laughed! Laughed her flipping head off, in fact!
After all these years...to finally get a laugh like that... Ahh, there's magical... Eh? Crying!? Me!? Shut up, mun! 'Course I en't!
Oi, Drippy-bach, what are you doing out of my guts? Typical you, that is! Fine! You run off and enjoy youerself! Don't mind youer pooer old mam! Hmph!
Littlies en't born right away. They have to learn how to talk and that first, en't it. They don't exactly come out eloquent, but they learn a word or two.
Mind you, it's Mam teaches them, so the words they know en't always what you'd expect...
The heroic human set out on a journey into Mam's tummy to rescue the children from danger...
...Crikey! You were standing right there!<NL>There's embarrassing...
Smiley 'n' Surly were flipping hilarious, mun!<NL>The future's looking bright for them two...
Reckon I'd better get an autograph before they start charging for them...
Always wanted to try my hand at comedy, I did, but I never quite had the guts.
If a joke of mine bombed, and the crowd went quiet, I think I'd shrivel up and die, mun!
Word is, there was a sinister figure behind Smiley 'n' Surly's return to form...
Apparently, he used magic to make them funny again. All very impressive, I'm sure, but using performance-enhancing spells is cheating, en't it?
Seems like Smiley 'n' Surly are out of their dodgy patch. Here's to a bright and hilarious future!
Mam en't laughed that hard since Drippy slipped on that babana skin! Smiley 'n' Surly are in the big leagues now, mun!
Smiley 'n' Surly's post-ironic storytelling style is all very well and good, but I find the Three Twins' traditional gag-making approach delivers the more regular laugh.
If you ask me, Smiley's the best one out of Smiley 'n' Surly. Only a sour-faced old cynic would think otherwise!
Smiley 'n' Surly are back on top, mun!<NL>Righto, partner of mine—we need to up ouer game!
Oi! Are you listening to me?
Oi-oi! It's my hero! How do?<NL>Saw you flying out of the cannon, I did!
The way you waved youer arms and legs around in the air like that—comedy gold, it was! Wish I could do something that funny!
Eh, eh, what about that human littlie, though, eh? Flying out of that cannon to get into Mam's tummy!
What a legend, making us laugh like that!<NL>Genius, it was! Gyuk gyuk gyuk!
If youer here, that must mean you used Mam's back passage, eh?
Well, you can go in and out by there anytime you like, so feel free, en't it.
Oi! It's s'posed to be a comedy whack, not a comedy punch! That flipping hurt!
Word around town is, you lot helped Smiley 'n' Surly come back from the comedy grave.
Nice one, Drippy-boy! I knew if anyone could help those pooer lads, it was you.
I'm ready! Give me youer best comedy whack!<NL>Go on! Really put youer back into it!
I was stargazing last night, right, and I seen a shooting star, except it was shaped like a person.
Must've been an angel, don't you reckon?<NL>Tidy! My luck's about to change!
Flip, mun, Mam swallowed you whole!?<NL>She must have an even bigger appetite than me! And that's saying something!
Right, let's see... We got Smiley 'n' Surly keyrings, Smiley 'n' Surly dolls, Smiley 'n' Surly signature edition slapsticks...
This lot'll make me a tidy pile!<NL>Megabucks!
Did you see Mam laughing? Crikey, that was something to behold! I thought I was going to get blown off my feet!
Hang on, mun, you never even liked Smiley 'n' Surly, did you?
I dunno what came over me, mun, honest!<NL>I just...had to...wallop you one! Yuk yuk yuk!
'Course I did, mun! Been hoping they'd find their form again for ages, I have! Come on, let's celebrate!
Waiter! Ten bogey tarts, and make 'em snotty!
Hmm... Well, it en't bad.<NL>It's definitely funny, like...
But after seeing Smiley 'n' Surly smash it like that, everything else seems a bit...tame.
Yeah, mun. Course, mun. I'm listening. Go on...
Oi, mate, gis another plate of dog sausages, will you?
I know, mun! Of all the ways to get in there—a flipping huge great big cannon like that...
And the look on his face when he was flying through the air! Priceless, it was! Na-ah-ah-ah!
The food round by here is the richest, most complex cuisine imaginable! Whether it's snail eggs or honeyed bunions, you can't go wrong!
Everyone in the Fairyground's arguing like mad about who's better out of Smiley 'n' Surly.
If you ask me, Surly's the best by miles. Only a total plonker would think otherwise!
Comedy en't just yabbering on in a funny way, you know. You need to practice set-ups and punch lines and all that. Proper hard work, it is.
We fairies may talk rough, but we got hearts of gold, en't it.
Why else would we be so chirpy all the time?<NL>You'll never see a fairy in a grump!
You never know what's going to happen next in life.
So if you don't prepare for anything, you'll be equally ready for everything! Simple!
How do, little man!<NL>What did it feel like, then?<NL>Flying through the air like that, I mean...
Yahahahahahahaaa! Flip, mun! That was too flipping funny! I can't stop flipping laughing! My flipping sides are about to flipping split!
Zzz... Nah, mun... 'Course not, mun...<NL>Mmm... Zzz...

pla-e_060_010-t12_npc_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Tidy! The littlies got born! Ahh, makes you realize what's been missing round by here lately—a good old-fashioned birthday party!
I always forget what a sight it is to see old Mam pop out a batch of littlies... Disgusting...but somehow compelling at the same time.
How do, my loves!
I thought I told you to give me a bit of warning before you drop in, Drippy-bach! Here I am with no makeup on or nothing! What must I look like!?
Here, have you got a bit fat, love?
We were so sad when we saw you over by youer way, all crying and upset, Oliver love. Lucky we fairies know how to cheer a person up, eh?
Has that little black flying nuisance finally cleared off, has he?
Thank goodness for that, mun! What a pain he was, buzzing around my head when I was trying to sleep and causing mischief! Good riddance, I say!
When the littlies get born, they land in the river, and we all have a party! It's a favorite fixture on the fairy festival calendar!
What were you doing popping out of Mam with them, though? Gave us all a right old shock, you did! Har dee har dee har!
Oh, youer that little traveling boy, en't you? <NL>Tell us a story about where you been, then.
I need a bit of new material, see. Come on!<NL>And make it good and juicy! Har dee har dee har!
Them littlies made a lovely job of popping out of Mam. Perfect form, lovely landing...at least a 9.0, I reckon.
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop!<NL>Just like that! Thing of beauty, it was!
Welcome home, you!<NL>...Eh? This en't youer home?
Don't be like that, mun! You got born with the littlies!<NL>Youer one of us now!
Smiley 'n' Surly are proper funny, but there's some serious competition coming up through the ranks.
The Tidy Titters Comedy Festival's going to be a competition and a flipping half this year! I can't wait, mun!
Come on, mun...<NL>When's the next show starting?
I heard all about you getting born with the littlies! Amazing!
Oh, and happy birthday!
Drippy-boy's been sending selected highlights of youer adventures back home to us all via the old telepathy!
Every installment's a proper nail-biter!<NL>On the edge of my seat every time, I am!<NL>Keep up the good work, you lot!
Smiley 'n' Surly's surprise comeback gave me a real boost. Inspired me to try my hand at the old comedy game myself.
Yep. I'm going to win the Tidy Titters Comedy Festival and be the talk of the Fairyground, just you wait and see!
How do, Drippy-boy!<NL>You going to watch the next show before you head off?
The act coming up are only young 'uns.<NL>Next big thing, I reckon.<NL>You should check 'em out.
The rebirth of Smiley 'n' Surly has really reinvigorated the comedy circuit.
They've raised the bar, and everyone else is trying that bit harder as a result.
Have you seen this year's batch of littlies?<NL>Proper round they are, and smooth as you like!<NL>I'd love to give one a good comedy whack!
If you ask me, they'll make proper tidy sidekicks! Every single one!
If you ask me, this batch of littlies need intensive sidekick skills training right from the off!
We can't get lazy just because everyone's celebrating the littlies getting born. We need to get them on a strict diet of comedy right away!
Righto, partner of mine—it's time to teach the next generation of funny-men! Let's enfunnifyyy!
Seems like everyone wants to be a comedian these days. The competition has hotted right up!
Righto, partner of mine—we're going to have to fight even harder to win that comedy crown!
Ahh, what a day, mun! This calls for a celebration! A plate of youer finest fish lips, my man, and don't scrimp on the hundreds and thousands!
Youer born sidekick material, you are! I can tell just looking at you. Right, let's get a routine together, shall we?
Um... So I say... Um... Knickers.
There's only one thing to do on a day of celebration like this—eat! I'm going to stuff myself silly!
Same as I do every day!
Oi! Stop looking at my dinner! Get youer own!<NL>Toenail fritters en't cheap, you know!
Go on, then. You can have one if you give matey next to me a proper comedy whack. Gyuk gyuk gyuk!
Blimey, what's everyone so het up about?<NL>...Oh, littlies got born, did they? Tidy!
Here's to the Fairyground getting even livelier!
There's not many can appreciate a quiet little out-of-the-way place like this one. Well, I s'pose there's Dai. And Rhys. And Rhodri and Huw and Dafydd and Iestyn and...
How come you only ever look happy when youer whacking me round the head?
Are you sure it's a comedian you want to be?<NL>Not a wrestler or a teacher or something?
Ahh, congratulations, everyone!<NL>This calls for a celebration!
I'll pay for dinner for everybody in here!<NL>Which is...me! Myaaa-hahahaha!
Sit down, pal, sit down! Come and have a bite to eat.<NL>The lice-cream by here's proper tasty!
That act just now... The timing was bang on...<NL>I need to learn how they do it...
Waheeey! Everybody celebrate!
...What's that? Why does Mam have an emergency exit in her back passage? Well now, that, my lad...
...is for grown-ups to know, and littlies to find out!
Wohohohoho! Them littlies are cute as anything, mun! Like little boiled eggs, they are! I could just gobble them up!
...O-Only joking.<NL>I'd never eat the future of fairykind.<NL>'Course not... Not unless I was starving, like...
Keep it coming, chief! I'll eat whatever you got!<NL>Hair cakes, spit rissoles, I don't mind!
Seeing them pure, innocent littlies almost makes me want to give up my money-grubbing ways... Almost...
We fairies pride ouerselves on ouer quality cuisine and ouer cracking comedy! And I'm going to export ouer culture to the world!
...Not for profit, you understand, just to teach people about ouer way of life, you know. Like a sort of ambassador kind of thing. ...Honest!
I en't a big fan of getting wet, but jumping in the river looks like a lot of fun...
Shall I do it...?<NL>Shall I not do it...?<NL>Flip, mun, I dunno!
We have to make sure not to leave litter or dirty socks or anything like that inside Mam's tummy. We don't want to make her poorly, see.
Because when she gets poorly, it's proper dangerous. One sneeze could blow down half the flipping town!
Give over, mun!<NL>You celebrate even when littlies en't getting born.
It's any old flipping excuse for a party with you!
It's not my fault, mun! It's just you make such a stupid face every time I does it. Cracks me up, it does! Yuk yuk yuk!
What are you saying, mun?<NL>You want me to give up the comedy game?
And miss the chance to see you make that stupid face every time I clout you? Never in a million years! Yuk yuk yuk!
Yahoy! It's the littlies' birthday!<NL>This calls for a celebration!
The milky barf is on me!
Wahey! It's not every day we get visitors round here. This calls for a celebration!
Sweatshakes all round!
Wonder what's on next...<NL>I hope it's good...
Two squirrel's faces, when you've got a moment, mate. Oh, and a couple of them chocolate-coated kidneys. Ta!
(sigh) I got into the comedy game for a bit of fun, but my partner's super flipping enthusiastic. I feel like a right old lazybones...
...All right. Come on then, partner! Let's have a go at one of these routines youer always trying to get me to do, shall we?
Did you see how many of them littlies came flying out! The Fairyground's going to be a lot livelier from now on!
But I'll still be the liveliest!<NL>Na-ah-ah-ah!
I dunno why, but I always laugh, even when things en't funny. D'you reckon there's something wrong with me?
...What's that? Hit on the head? Well, a few times... And kicked in the shins, and poked in the eye... Na-ah-ah-ah!
I loves littlie season, I does! Everyone's happy, and you can have a laugh with just about anyone! Marvelous, it is!
The Savior whom the legends of the Fairyground say will deliver us all from evil...Oliver!
...That's how we'll be selling you to the tourists anyway, so don't go messing it up, right?
Proper glad this batch of littlies made it out safe, I am!
If you ask me, these latest littlies need training in how to be skilled straight men right from the off!
Ohhh, I feel rough, mun... Reckon it must be from jumping in that river. You'll look after me if I get sick, won't you, Drippy-boy?
Every month, we all go up to see Mam and give her a good old hose-down and a scrub. It's like one of them baths you humans have.
...What's that? You bathe more than once a month?<NL>Well, it's not my fault youer a clean freak, is it?
It's been a long time since we had new littlies born. And it was thanks to you lot, I hear. Ta and that!
Enjoy youer stay here in the Fairyground! It's a lively old place, but they're a decent bunch, this lot!
Tidy! The littlies got born!<NL>Nice one, Mam! Nice one, you lot!
They may be little round eggy things now, but them littlies'll soon start taking all kinds of different shapes.
That's just one of the Seven Wonders of the Fairyground! ...What? The other six? Youer guess is as good as mine, mun!
Everyone's been having a go at the old comedy lately.
All working together to make each other laugh.<NL>Ahh, there's beautiful!

pla-f_010_010-t04_npc_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
Ah, who'd be a merchant, I ask you? The amount of red tape I have to go through to get anything done! It's hardly worth the trouble.
A land of endeavor and invention, Hamelin is the envy of the world. And it's all down to good honest hard work!
Oh, it's that time again! It won't be long now before it gets under way. I can hardly wait!
Hm? You're wondering what I'm talking about? Ah, you'll find out soon enough!
I say, you did remember to wind up the grandfather clock in the hall, didn't you?
Dear me. I went to all the trouble of having a pair of rather fetching bathing trunks imported from Castaway Cove.
But then I was told by an official that they contravened the law on minimum trouser length!
Oi! What are you lot up to!? If you want to gawp at machines, can't you do it elsewhere? There's no shortage round here.
Your armor looks a little past its best, I fear. Why not trade it in for a newer model?
You think those giant wheels on the streets are impressive? That's just the tip of the iceberg!
I came all the way from Ding Dong Dell to study the technological advances in Hamelin, but it's hard to know where to start...
She's my number one student. One day, her discoveries will change the world, you mark my words.
I've been working as an engineer for more years than I care to remember. But will I ever retire? Not on your life! I love my work!
Oh, I say! I'd almost forgotten what people looked like without pig masks on.
Well, apart from the Prince's servant, of course. He never wears one.
We've had to wear armor for quite a while here in Hamelin, and it gets heavier with each passing year. Ah, I'm getting old...
A town called Perdida lies somewhere in the mountains to the north. Few have been there, but those that have say it's truly stunning.
I'd love to take my old lady and watch the sunset there one day.
Innovators such as I have no time to concern<NL>ourselves with our personal appearance. It makes one grateful for these pig suits!
Have you tried the local black truffles? You can't walk ten paces in this city without catching the scent of one... (sniff)
Most of my meager wages are frittered away on those mouthwatering morsels...
I'd love to visit Castaway Cove one day. Just imagine! The sea breeze... The salty air... And all those swimsuits!
Ah, I noticed you admiring my snout...<NL>It actually functions as a filter, keeping out all manner of noxious gases.
It's rather ingenious, wouldn't you say?
The great thing about this helmet is that I can forget to brush my hair, and no one will ever know!
Are you lot travelers then?<NL>Mind how you go, won't you?
I heard there's this famous engineer who can actually talk to machines! Fancy that!
Don't worry, dear. I saw to it before I left the house.
Gosh! What a pretty fairy!<NL>One doesn't see many of your kind around here.
So you're travelers, are you? Well make yourselves at home. By which I mean, don't break any laws.
To really learn the nuts and bolts of Hamelin's technology, you have to pay your dues as an engineer's apprentice.
...They say it is not so very far from here...but I don't suppose I shall ever see it.
You don't get many foreign goods coming into<NL>Hamelin these days. You can't get hold of a babana for love nor money.
Argh! Curse these stupid outfits! They call us Hamelin Hogs behind our backs, you know?
I spent ages on my makeup, not that you'd know.<NL>I'm pretty as a picture underneath this silly helmet!
The Taskmaster was telling me some tales of your death-defying derring-do.
I can't believe you're the same age as me and you're already on a real adventure!
The guards wear different helmets to normal folks.<NL>Their eyes look scary!
The Prince always has his subjects' best interests at heart. He makes them wear armor to keep them safe.
Article 1353 of the constitution forbids any loitering on the streets at night. ...Or was that article 3135? Hmmm...
I just got a right earful from my wife! She didn't want to come out, so I told her she should just stay at home. She didn't like that!
Hmph. It used to be a pleasure working here, but since all these infernal rules and regulations came into effect, it's become a right old pain.
I just wish this pig armor was a little more...flattering. I mean, a few frills and a couple of bows wouldn't hurt, would they?
Master! I've tempered those cogs just as you asked me to.
You aren't from Hamelin, are you? Sorry, but this is as far as an outsider is going to get.

Oh, youer that little traveling boy, en't you? <NL>Tell us a story about where you been, then.
I need a bit of new material, see. Come on!<NL>And make it good and juicy! Har dee har dee har!
Welcome home, you!<NL>...Eh? This en't youer home?
Don't be like that, mun! You got born with the littlies!<NL>Youer one of us now!
Smiley 'n' Surly are proper funny, but there's some serious competition coming up through the ranks.
The Tidy Titters Comedy Festival's going to be a competition and a flipping half this year! I can't wait, mun!
Come on, mun...<NL>When's the next show starting?
Drippy-boy's been sending selected highlights of youer adventures back home to us all via the old telepathy!
Every instalment's a proper nailbiter!<NL>On the edge of my seat every time, I am!<NL>Keep up the good work, you lot!
Smiley 'n' Surly's surprise comeback gave me a real boost. Inspired me to try my hand at the old comedy game myself.
Yep. I'm going to win the Tidy Titters Comedy Festival and be the talk of the Fairyground, just you wait and see!
How do, Drippy-boy!<NL>You going to watch the next show before you head off?
The act coming up are only young 'uns.<NL>Next big thing, I reckon.<NL>You should check 'em out.
The rebirth of Smiley 'n' Surly has really reinvigorated the comedy circuit.
They've raised the bar, and everyone else is trying that bit harder as a result.
If you ask me, this batch of littlies need intensive sidekick skills training right from the off!
Seems like everyone wants to be a comedian these days. The competition has hotted right up!
Righto, partner of mine—we're going to have to fight even harder to win that comedy crown!
Youer born sidekick material, you are! I can tell just looking at you. Right, let's get a routine together, shall we?
Um... So I say... Um... Knickers.
Oi! Stop looking at my dinner! Get youer own!<NL>Toenail fritters en't cheap, you know!
Go on, then. You can have one if you give matey next to me a proper comedy whack.<NL>Gyuk gyuk gyuk!
There's not many can appreciate a quiet little out-of-the-way place like this one. Well, I s'pose there's Dai. And Rhys. And Rhodri and Huw and Dafydd and Iestyn and...
Are you sure it's a comedian you want to be?<NL>Not a wrestler or a teacher or something?
Sit down, pal, sit down! Come and have a bite to eat.<NL>The lice-cream by here's proper tasty!
That act just now... The timing was bang on...<NL>I need to learn how they do it...
...What's that? Why does Mam have an emergency exit in her back passage? Well now, that, my lad...
...is for grown-ups to know, and littlies to find out!
Keep it coming, chief! I'll eat whatever you got!<NL>Hair cakes, spit rissoles, I don't mind!
We fairies pride ouerselves on ouer quality cuisine and ouer cracking comedy! And I'm going to export ouer culture to the world!
...Not for profit, you understand, just to teach people about ouer way of life, you know. Like a sort of ambassador kind of thing. ...Honest!
We have to make sure not to leave litter or dirty socks or anything like that inside Mam's tummy. We don't want to make her poorly, see.
Because when she gets poorly, it's proper dangerous. One sneeze could blow down half the flipping town!
It's any old flipping excuse for a party with you!
What are you saying, mun?<NL>You want me to give up the comedy game?
And miss the chance to see you make that stupid face every time I clout you? Never in a million years! Yuk yuk yuk!
Wahey! It's not every day we get visitors round here. This calls for a celebration!
Sweatshakes all round!
Wonder what's on next...<NL>I hope it's good...
(sigh) I got into the comedy game for a bit of fun, but my partner's super flipping enthusiastic. I feel like a right old lazybones...
...All right. Come on then, partner! Let's have a go at one of these routines youer always trying to get me to do, shall we?
I dunno why, but I always laugh, even when things en't funny. D'you reckon there's something wrong with me?
...What's that? Hit on the head? Well, a few times... And kicked in the shins, and poked in the eye... Na-ah-ah-ah!
The Savior whom the legends of the Fairyground say will deliver us all from evil...Oliver!
...That's how we'll be selling you to the tourists anyway, so don't go messing it up, right?
If you ask me, these latest littlies need training in how to be skilled straight men right from the off!
Aaand...fall over! Hmm, not bad, but I got to get my timing better...
Every month, we all go up to see Mam and give her a good old hose-down and a scrub. It's like one of them baths you humans have.
...What's that? You bathe more than once a month?<NL>Well, it's not my fault youer a clean freak, is it?
Enjoy youer stay here in the Fairyground! It's a lively old place, but they're a decent bunch, this lot!
They may be little round eggy things now, but them littlies'll soon start taking all kinds of different shapes.
That's just one of the Seven Wonders of the Fairyground! ...What? The other six? Youer guess is as good as mine, mun!
Everyone's been having a go at the old comedy lately.
All working together to make each other laugh.<NL>Ahh, there's beautiful!
Zzz... (snort) Mmm... Zzz...
Come on, mun! Come on, mun!<NL>Come ooon!
En't it, though! En't it!<NL>En't it, though!
Is it, though? Is it, though?<NL>Is it?
No fair! No fair! No fair!
No worries! Safe, mun!<NL>Safe!
Play! Play! Fun!
Nah, mun, nah!<NL>Mah, mun, mah!
Chewy! Chewy!
Proper! Proper! Tidy!
Hee hee! Ha ha!<NL>Funny! Funny!
Eaty! Eaty!<NL>Din dins!
Fun! Fun! Fun!

Take some time to explore the world!
Weigh anchor and set sail for Hamelin!
You've finally arrived in Hamelin! Take a look around the city!

pla-f_020_010-t04_npc_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I don't know what you're planning to do in that armor, and I don't want to know...
Some rotten swine gave me a shove in the back during the procession. I nearly fell under the Prince's train!
...I mean, there were rules back in the old emperor's day, but nothing compared to what we have to put up with now. It's bureaucracy gone mad is what it is!
If you're not on your guard during royal processions, you might end up on the wrong end of a spinning building. Happens all the time.
Hamelin's technology is the envy of the world. And it's all down to good old-fashioned elbow grease.
As much as I love them, these royal processions can be a little nerve-racking. Last time, I was almost flattened by a fast-moving building...
Tell me dear, did you remember to switch off the light in the living room?
Dear me. I went to all the trouble of having a pair of rather fetching bathing trunks imported from Castaway Cove.
But then I was told by an official that they contravened the law on minimum trouser length!
Oi, you! You may not be from Hamelin, but<NL>if you like machines, I can learn to like you.
Don't be shy about dropping by!
Your armor looks a little past its best, I fear. Why not trade it in for a newer model?
They say the cogs under the buildings are so big, a hundred men couldn't lift them!
Every man, woman and child in Hamelin knows the difference between a crankshaft and a piston rod. What an enlightened place!
Machines and rain just don't mix. That's why we've got a great big roof covering the whole city.
She's my number one student. One day, her discoveries will change the world, you mark my words.
No one forgets the first royal procession they see in Hamelin. You'll never look at buildings the same way again!
Oh, I say! I'd almost forgotten what people<NL>looked like without a pig mask on.
Well, apart from the Prince's servant, of course. He never wears one.
We've had to wear armor for quite a while here in Hamelin, and it gets heavier with each passing year. Ah, I'm getting old...
Have you ever heard tell of Perdida? They say the plains around it glisten like gold in the sun...
Someone told me that the roof covering our city is not just to keep the rain off...
But they didn't tell me what else it was protecting us from. Your guess is as good as mine.
I've seen a fair few places, but nowhere that was half as developed as Hamelin!
Do you know what people from other kingdoms call us? "Hamelin Hogs"! Can you believe their cheek?
We have serious research to do. These pig suits mean we don't have to concern ourselves with piffling matters like personal appearance.
Have you tried the local black truffles? You can't walk ten paces in this city without catching the scent of one... (sniff)
Most of my meager wages are frittered away on those mouthwatering morsels...
I've ordered a swimsuit. I'm going to wear it under my armor and pretend I'm on holiday in Castaway Cove.
Ah, I noticed you admiring my gloves... They're so thick, I could juggle red-hot coal all day without batting an eyelid.
They're quite splendid, don't you think?
The great thing about this helmet is that I can forget to brush my hair, and no one will ever know!
Hmmm... You're a funny-looking troop.<NL>Have I seen you lot before?
Well, whatever your story is, you need to take up your positions, quick smart.
It's not just for processions, you know. Sometimes they shift the streets about just because they can.
They say the location of the Black Market changes every time. I wonder where it is now.
Don't worry, I made sure I turned all the lights out before I left the house.
Be patient, I told you! You're still growing! That armor will fit perfectly if you wait long enough!
Gah! Can you believe children are forced to wear armor too? It costs a pretty penny to keep them kitted out, I can tell you.
Just be patient! If I've told you once—<NL>Oh... Oh, I am sorry! Brave boarriors like you shouldn't have to listen to me ranting and raving.
The plains around Hamelin are hopping with jackrabbots. They're decent sorts really, so why not try recruiting one?
Oh, and if you're looking for a good battle-ready creature, I recommend adding a clinketyclank to your number. They're tough, and quick on their feet too.
Hello, young man. I hope you and your friends aren't here to make mischief.
...I'm sure you're not. It's just that I've come across some rum sorts in the past.
Now then, young man, playing dress-up, are we? Are you hoping they'll let you join the army?
In Hamelin, we don't compete with one another. We all work together for the greater good of the Empire.
There is an area of extraordinary natural beauty here in Autumnia...though few have seen it.
Hamelin really is the place to be! It's got all manner of clever devices and gadgets to make one's life easier. It's just a shame about the helmets...
I wouldn't be surprised if they pass a law forcing dogs to wear armor too...
You don't get many foreign goods coming into<NL>Hamelin these days. You can't get hold of a babana for love nor money.
(gasp) Guards! I-I didn't notice you there! Y-You're doing a sterling job guarding Hamelin.<NL>(Eh? ...Is that a walking helmet?)
Argh! Curse these stupid outfits! They call us Hamelin Hogs behind our backs, you know!
They say there's a backstreet blacksmith who will inlay the inside of your helmet with gold leaf... Now that's what I call style!
Granny! This pig armor is too big and heavy for me!
The Taskmaster was telling me some tales of your death-defying derring-do.
I can't believe you're the same age as me and you're already on a real adventure!
Guards wear different helmets to normal folks. Their eyes look scary!
The Prince always has his subjects' best interests at heart. He makes them wear armor to keep them safe.
Article 2546 of the constitution forbids any unauthorized building of rails on the roads. ...Would anyone seriously do that?
Hm? Are you lot new recruits? I've never seen armor like that before. Is it a new design, or what?
So the procession's done with...<NL>Now, let's see if my dear wife is still sulking...
I often wonder what the Prince is thinking. He's imposing far too many rules and regulations, if you ask me... B-But don't tell anyone I said that!
However much they tell us to dress the same, we still want to be ourselves.
Master! I have cut that iron diamond to perfection!
You aren't from Hamelin, are you? Sorry, but this is as far as an outsider is going to get.
Normally, this is as far as I'd let an outsider get, but that fellow you're with shared some rather juicy gossip with me...
In exchange for which, I'm going to turn a blind eye. On you go!
Urck! G-Guards! Uhh... Keep up the good work!!!<NL>(...How did they get in here!?)
Look, you're not going any further, and that's that.
Come on! Get a move on! You've got goods to deliver, don't you?
You really are slow on the uptake, aren't you? Look, you're not entering the palace, and that's that.
Ah, truffles... My tummy's rumbling just thinking about them.
Hm? Who in blazes are you?<NL>Over here where I can see you!<NL>State your name, rank and purpose!
J-Jeepers... I think we might be in trouble!
Don't panic, Ollie-boy! In situations like this, I've found the best thing to do is keep youer cool, look them straight in the eye...
...and then flipping LEG IT!!!
Eh? I don't remember hearing about any new recruits? There's something fishy going on here...
Hang about! Are you telling me we really have to go down there?
Gah! We can't put it off forever though, I s'pose.<NL>Knickers...
Hang about, Ollie-boy! We need to use ouer heads, and think before we move. Otherwise those porkers will sniff us out in no time flat.
First thing to do is press [btn_r1], and get out the old <color:#1>map</color>. Looking at that'll help you work out where the guards are going, en't it!
This place is crawling with the blighters, so you'll need to use [stk_r] to check if the coast is clear before strolling round any corners.
Oh, and if you take a proper close look at that map of youers, I bet you'll spot some handy <color:#1>nooks</color> dotted round the place.
If we hide in them, the guards'll never spot us.
The thing about those pig helmets they wear is that they can only see what's right in front of their snouts.
So if we don't get carried away and <color:#1>stray too close</color> to them, I reckon we'll be all right. Got all that, have you? Tidy! Let's do this, shall we?

The Prince's servant is actually the Great Sage!? Head to the palace!
Go to the Black Market to get some grunt armor!

Sneak into the palace disguised as a grunt!
Make your way through the palace without being spotted!
Jump down the manhole!

You've been spotted! Time to make your escape!
The Prince is brokenhearted! Find him some belief!

And where do you think-k-k-k you're going?
Agh! It can speak!
Mwahahaha! How very observant of you, boy! Now, let's have a look-k-k-k at you... Oh dear... Oh dear me...<NL>It would seem you are...alive and well!
This will not do! This will not do at all! I c-c-cannot let you pass! We'll have no heartbeats here! This area is<NL>stric-c-ctly c-c-corpses only!
R-Really? But we won't cause any trouble, honest we won't... Please let us pass, Mr. Skeleton!
Mwahahaha! Over my live body! The only way you're getting past me is dead—just like everyone else.<NL>Is that c-c-clear?
...You'll only let us pass if we're dead!?<NL>That's...asking kind of a lot, you know.
You think just because we're dead, we have no principles? No c-c-code of c-c-conduc-c-ct to die by? So long as you breathe, you're barred. "Live" with it! Mwahahaha!
What are we going to do?
Simple! We do as the man says, en't it?<NL>Time for a spot of dying, I reckon!
Huh!? Y-You don't mean—<NL>You want us to—?
Don't be daft, mun! I'm not asking you to ACTUALLY die! Just pretend, like! It en't that hard!
Pretend to be dead? But how?
With magic, of course! Now get that spellbook of youers out and find us <color:#1>a spell that lets you pretend youer dead</color>!
There's really a spell for that...?<NL>Okay...I guess I'll take a look...
Is it just me, or did it get a lot darker all of a sudden?<NL>I don't like the look of this...
I-I can't see where I'm going! It's too dark!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Use youer head! You've got the perfect <color:#1>spell for brightening things up</color> a bit, en't it?
You're right!
What's all this then? A little run-down shack, is it?
It doesn't look like anybody's lived here for a long time.
Well, that'll do nicely, then!<NL>Let's have a kip, shall we?
Are you sure that's a good idea, Mr. Drippy? I mean...it looks kinda creepy... But I guess we could rest here for a little while...
This is the domain of the deceased. No heartbeats allowed! Of c-c-course, I'll happily rec-c-consider letting you past...<color:#1>when you're dead</color>! Mwahahaha!
Come on, Ollie-boy!<NL>Brighten things up a bit, will you?
Look at this place, mun! This door's so flipping rusty, it won't budge an inch.
Bah, the path's blocked good and proper. No amount of pushing and shoving will get us through there.
Hmm... Maybe there's some sort of trick to it?<NL>Or does that seem a bit far-fetched?
Did you feel that shaking just now?
And what about all that noise from over by the other side? It made my lantern rattle, mun.
Hold on! My fairy senses tell me we might be able to carry on up the path now. And my fairy senses never lie!
If you pass through this c-c-cave, you'll find a mighty altar... Or you would if the path weren't block-ck-cked. Mwahahaha!
They say that <color:#1>c-c-candlelight</color> may open the way ahead. But I'm afraid I don't have a light...

pla-f_050_010-t04_npc_text_en.cfg.bin.kup
I will gladly share my heart.<NL>Come, take it!
Whatever challenges face our realm—whether sought or unsought—we must overcome them. That is the way of Hamelin.
You must find Mornstar and show your true worth as a wizard. Then, and only then, will you be able to return to your own time.
Begone, I say! You must not look at my hideous face!
Powdered ulk horn! Fresh black truffles!<NL>There's nothing old Abel ain't able to get!
Caw! I hope you didn't travel far to get here. There's nothing for you to do, I'm afraid.
Not much in the way of work today, Ollie-boy. Then again, we've got enough on ouer plate as it is.
Whatever is the matter with you? You're staring at me in a way that's making me ever so slightly uncomfortable.
So, you like my style, do you? These clothes are rather fetching, if I do say so myself!
What do you think of my dress? Pretty, is it not? I made a few adjustments to the skirt to give it extra lift and bounce!
The style in Hamelin is to make little tweaks here and there, and really make a statement with what you wear.
My old mum is the Emperor's biggest fan.<NL>Mad about him, she is.
Personally, I like the two princes. They're just so adorable! Ahh, the future is looking bright!
They say the Emperor is descended from a long line of sages. That's what lies behind Hamelin's heady mix of magic and machinery.
Ah, I've got all sorts of exciting ideas for accessories for my clothes!
Oh, he's so handsome... Every day, he stands there, with his shiny armor, protecting the main thoroughfare. What a fine fellow.
I recommend going off the beaten track in Hamelin. The backstreets have real character.
My grandchildren and I just love gazing up at the palace.
The quarter of the city is just brimming with life and laughter. Long may it last!
Is that right? The folks in Ding Dong Dell took a shine to it, did they?
Well, the watches we make in Hamelin are the best in the world, after all.
Ah, you're quite right, of course. I'm sorry I doubted you.
I've heard there's a little place down a backstreet which offers a fine selection of exotic fruit juices. Should we give it a try, do you think?
Nothing would make me happier than to share a drink with my mentor and inspiration.
Do you fancy coming too?
I wanted to become a brave boarrior, defending Hamelin, but they said they didn't have any armor in my size...
They need to make extra-large sizes!<NL>How else am I possibly going to fit!?
Hm? What was that? Sorry. I was miles away.
I was just wondering how many black truffles a man could eat before he burst.
When I visited Ding Dong Dell, everyone wanted to look at the watch my grandfather made me.
It just goes to show there's nowhere that can touch Hamelin when it comes to technical prowess.
I'm still no match for my mother. I suppose I'll just have to keep on training.
I'd love to see a ghost, but there's just no way to get to the valley in the north.
If only someone would clear that path...
Oi you! That fellow across the street wants his music box repaired! Stop idling and grease those cogs, will you?
Our little workshop can't afford to turn down any job, no matter how small.
I had my son attach a little windmill to the chimney, thinking the children would like it. It seemed like a good idea at the time...
But now I'm worried it might cause a collision when the building moves. Oh dear me, I hope I shan't have to pay a fine...
The Emperor was quite a looker when he was a young man. I've got a portrait of him hanging above the mantelpiece.
It's just a little one, but I gaze at it each and every day.
I've got a pig of my very own! I'm going to enter him in this year's Truffle Snuffle Challenge!
Granddad, look at the palace!<NL>It's so bright and beautiful!
Ha! I love my new tunic!
My father bought it for me. He's the best!
Welcome to Hamelin!<NL>We hope you enjoy your stay here.
Why not take a closer look at my armor?<NL>It's the very latest model, don't you know?
Don't worry! I shan't fine you! Just be more careful next time!
Who'll come with me to Perdida? We'll run away and raise llapacas, and chew hay, and live in peace. Come on! Who's in?
If you can't find it in a regular shop, chances are they'll stock it in the Black Market.
Who knows where they get their goods from?
Where would I rather be? Under the gentle glow of the gas lights of Hamelin, or basking in the sun on the plains below Perdida? Ah, I can't choose!
Hm... I'm afraid you're a little too big to model the clothes I've made.
Well? What is it that's so interesting? Are you intending to stare a hole right through me?
What's that? Pig's trotter shoes? Um... You do say the most peculiar things, young man.
Yay! I'm going to get my uncle to build me a piglet tank! It'll be brilliant!
The pair of us were just discussing ideas for new and exciting inventions. Do you have anything to contribute?
So I'm thinking of a tank that looks like a pig...but it's actually a money box! And when it fills up, coins shoot out of the cannon!
Are the two of you going out for a drink after dinner?<NL>I suppose I'll join you, if you insist.
They say there are all sorts of terrifying ghosts haunting the valley to the north of here.
It's very dangerous, so mind you keep well away from it.
This looks like a dingy back alley, but we've had royalty from far-off lands coming to visit.
Folks come to the Black Market from all over in search of all manner of rare and precious goods.
Make me a pig tank! Go on!
When I grow up, I want to be able to use magic like a Great Sage!
What's that? You think I'm a little small to be a soldier? Well, I'm in the engineering corps.
It's about brains, not brawn, you see.
I spend every day up to my elbows in grease mending pig tanks. Why can't I work on some kind of flying machine?
It would have to be something more exciting than a boring old Cloud Sweeper, though. How about some kind of flying pig-based craft?
The Emperor doesn't betray much emotion, but I can tell he really cares for his sons. And why wouldn't he? Gascon and Marcassin are fine boys.
I've heard some truly spine-chilling tales of ghosts in the valley to the north of here... It's lucky I don't believe in ghosts, eh?
Please! I beg of you! Do all you can to help the princes!
On behalf of the entire Empire, I beseech you to do something!
Hm? I thought I heard a sound coming from the inner courtyard. Did I imagine it?
The Emperor... Oh, this is too much to bear.
The Emperor ordered us not to do anything to assist the princes. I must obey, though it pains me.
The Tombstone Trail lies to the north of here. Please mind how you go.
Oh! I was sure Prince Gascon was accompanying you.
It is hard to imagine life without the Emperor. But we must go on. I vow that I will protect his son and heir with my life.
Emperor

Get out of here! Go!<NL>Begone, I say!
Pooer lad's still brokenhearted, that's for definite.<NL>A shadow of his former self, he is.
He needs a dose of <color:#1>belief</color>, and he needs it snappy!
Come on, mun... It's what his dad would have wanted!
Cease your maddening chatter, fairy! My father died fifteen years ago! Do not claim to know his will!
So all that carry-on was fifteen years ago, was it? And this pooer lad's been on his own ever since... There's tragic.
Uh...Your Highness? We brought you something. A gift. It's from fifteen years ago. We got it from...well...<NL>We got it from you.
A-Anyway, if it's okay, we'd like you to have it...back...
...What did you say?<NL>What is the meaning of this?
...What is this!?<NL>This... This glow...
You claim you met me fifteen years ago?<NL>What in blazes are you talking about?
Go on, Ollie-boy! It's time to blast this boy with a bit of <color:#1>belief</color>! Courtesy of his younger, nicer self!
Guess what, Youer Princeliness—we got all them stones!
You have Mornstar's magic stones?<NL>So you recovered the map from Kublai?
That's right, Your Highness!<NL>Well, actually, he kinda gave it to us...
Kublai helped you!? The sky pirate!?
He's not a bad sort, once you get to know him. He took us under his wing, like. Even gave us a dragon to fly about on! Tidy, eh!?
He gave you a dragon!? Can this be true?
It's true, Your Highness. Tengri helped us find the three magic stones. We couldn't have done it without him.
The problem now is how to stick the stones back into Mornstar, and I won't lie to you—we don't have<NL>the foggiest.
We were kinda hoping you might be able to help us,<NL>Your Highness...
Please give me the wand and the stones.<NL>I wish to examine them.
The sky pirate, <color:#1>Kublai</color>, stole the map with the locations of the magic stones marked upon it.
I think that finding him may be the only course available to you. Needless to say, I will do all in my power to assist you in this.
In my brokenhearted state, I imposed thousands of harsh rules and regulations on my long-suffering citizens.
I must now make amends for this by revising or repealing each and every one of them—a task that will keep me rather busy, I fear.
One of those who tutored me in the ways of magic was the Great Sage Khulan, Queen of Xanadu.
After my brother left, I traveled to Xanadu and the Temple of Trials in order to undergo my magical training.
Mornstar... It is complete.<NL>At last.
And Queen Khulan lives still. Things are in motion. I feel the hand of fate at work...
With the Clarion, I am certain you will be able to clear the miasma once and for all.
And then the curtain will rise on your final battle with Shadar.
Shadar... That monster took my father's life, and broke my heart.
I would dearly love to fight alongside you, but matters here will not permit it. Instead, I shall pray for your victory!
...!<NL>......!
Pale...silent...glowing... Yep! I reckon youer going to need to use a spell if you want to have a chat with this one, Ollie-boy!
Huh? It looks like this lady can't speak.
No, she's not dumb. She's just a bit dead! She's a ghost, looks like.
A gh-ghost?
That's what I said, didn't I? You know, I seem to remember seeing another one back in Ding Dong Dell.
Maybe if we paid that other ghost a visit, we could work out what we're doing wrong. Well, it's that or miming, I s'pose...and no one likes a mime.
Queen Khulan... The Queen of the Heavens...<NL>She lives still... I have not abandoned that hope.
...!<NL>......?
Tell me! Did you find her? Did you find Queen Khulan?
Hold youer horses! We'll tell you everything once we've gathered our thoughts together.
I am sorry. Please forgive my impatience.
...Then it is as I thought! Queen Khulan lives!
And judging by your account, Alph survived, too... Oh, you described him so perfectly! Truly, this day is filled with the gladdest of tidings!
Alph? You mean that guard we met?
Yes. That is he. For many years, we protected our queen—shoulder to shoulder... Alph and his Abyssinia...
When the Dark Djinn struck, we fought to save her...
And when the end came, I implored him to protect Queen Khulan till his dying breath...
Though her heart was cruelly broken, still Alph watched over her.
That's all very well, but you went and flipping died, didn't you? That can't have done youer relationship much good...
No...and nothing can change that. Yet I take solace from the fact that Alph and our queen still live...
In any case, it has done me good to speak with you. And who knows? I may yet see Alph again.
Hang about! Only wizards and that can see ghosts, meaning youer feller wouldn't be able to see you even if you did bump into—
Mr. Drippy!
Ha! It's all right. Your fairy friend is correct. But even though he could not see me, and we could not speak, I could watch over him.
Now, I wish to reward you for all the glad tidings you have brought me. Please, take this.
Thank you very much! But...um...what is it?
This is an elegant feather that the royal guards of Xanadu wore. Alph and I each cherished ours.
Gee... I sure do hope you get to meet him again—and Queen Khulan.
Thank you. I hope so too.
Thank you, all of you.
One day, I will visit Perdida. One day, when the oppressive evil that hangs over our land is dispelled.
......
Powdered ulk horn! Fresh black truffles!<NL>There's nothing old Abel ain't able to get!
Oh! It's good to see you all again.<NL>And in one piece, if these old eyes don't deceive me.
Ah, it's been quite a while since I had the pleasure.
Just look at this place! I'll bet youer raking it in, en't you?
Ha ha! Well, I do my best.<NL>Now, I've heard an interesting rumor...
It seems a gang got dressed up in grunt armor of various sizes and sneaked into the palace. Four of them, there were, counting the little one—or so they tell me.
Um... That's...um... Erm... Really?
Ha ha ha! Word travels fast, doesn't it?
And there's more. I heard that these intruders helped out the Prince. Turns out, he hadn't been feeling himself for some time.
Flipping heck! Is there anything he doesn't know?
Well, when you came sniffing around for armor, I had a fair idea of what you were up to.
I wasn't born yesterday, you know!
Look, mun... We're sorry if we've caused you any trouble, but it all turned out for the best, didn't it?
Indeed it did. And I'm actually grateful to you.
Why's that, Sir?
I've got two children, you see—a boy and a girl—and my daughter, Grace... Well, she's never been in the best of health.
Her brother Hogarth is one of the palace guards. Since the Prince went strange in the head, he hasn't been allowed any leave to visit us.
But with Prince Marcassin back to his old self, my son will surely be able to see us.
You should have seen my daughter smile when she heard the news. Over the moon, she was.
There's no medicine like time spent with the ones you love. Family is so important.
...It sure is.
So it turns out that you've really done me a favor. Now, I don't like being in any man's debt, so I'm going to reward you—and this time I'll do better than rusty old armor.
I can tell from what you're wearing that you're a wizard. And it just so happens that I've got something every wizard wants...
Neat! Pages from the Wizard's Companion!
You find all sorts of things doing the rounds at the Black Market. I just hope they come in handy.
I'm sure they will, Sir! Thank you!
When my daughter heard her brother would be coming home, she really perked up. There's no medicine like time spent with the ones you love.
Hmmm. Curious... I feel like we've met before... A long time ago...
But that can't be true...can it?
Ah, good day to you all! Ever since the law forcing us to wear armor was repealed, life's looked a whole lot better.
I wonder what could have happened to our prince?
I thought one of the perks of living in Hamelin was that there was never any rain or wind...
And then snow starts to fall... Who'd have believed it possible?
What's that? You want to know about the Black Market? Careful what you say, boy... The walls have ears.
The other day, I went to the Ministry to ask about opening a new shop. Turns out, all I needed to do was fill in a few forms. Simple as that! How times change...
I still have dreams about all the rules and regulations we used to have to put up with.
I keep having one where I'm all tangled up in red tape...and a giant stamp is about to— Ugh! I don't want to talk about it...
You know, I used to get bashed black and blue by moving buildings during royal processions.
But now that we don't have to wear armor, I can leap nimbly out of the way with seconds to spare!
Ah, I feel so light and carefree without that wretched armor weighing me down!
Perhaps I need to put my new-found fleet-footedness to good use... Could a new future as a dancer await?
Nowhere in the world has buildings as sturdy as Hamelin. But then one would expect no less from the home of endeavor and invention.
Gears, cogs, tanks, moving buildings... Hamelin's mix of magic and machinery has a long and proud history.
As much as I love them, these royal processions can be a little nerve-racking. Last time, I was almost flattened by a fast-moving building...
What just happened? That fluttering white stuff... Was it some kind of rehearsal for the next royal procession? It was like a dream...
Tell me dear, did you remember to switch off the light in the living room?
Tell me dear, did you see that strange white dust falling from the sky?
Do you remember I told you about my imported bathing trunks? The ones that were seized by the officials? Well, I found them on sale at the Black Market!
There are all sorts of shady forces at work in the world... I'll tell you all about them when you're a bit older.
Hee hee! I've just agreed to sell wares crafted by the city's leading goldsmith! It finally looks like I might be able to pay back my copious debts.
I thought I had a pocketful of guilders, but on closer inspection, it turned out to be a worthless pile of nuts and bolts.
I've got money on the mind, it seems. Perhaps I need to find some other interests.
Oi, you! You may not be from Hamelin, but<NL>if you like machines, I can learn to like you.
Don't be shy about dropping by!
Oh! It's you! Have you heard that the Prince has started repealing lots of his own laws. You didn't have a hand in all this, did you?
When I came to, I got up and clashed heads with the poor lady beside me.
She had one hard head, I'm telling you. You could knock nails in with a head like that.
If you want a proper job doing, you've got to go to a professional. That's my advice to you.
I got my grandfather's armor professionally polished, but now he doesn't need it anymore. So I thought I might as well wear it myself.
What's going on here? I'd only just got this armor looking nice! Why is there a big dent in the side!?
They say the cogs under the buildings are so big, a hundred men couldn't lift them!
Apparently there are manholes all round Hamelin to help with the maintenance of all the machines.
You knew that already? Hmph. Clever clogs. Well, I only just found out.
So I was just walking down the street, minding my own business, when I got caught up in this big wheel and was spun right round.
To tell the truth, I rather enjoyed it.
Every man, woman and child in Hamelin knows the difference between a crankshaft and a piston rod. What an enlightened place!
I'm so glad I came to Hamelin. I've seen at first hand the way things are made here.
I suppose I should be getting back to Ding Dong Dell, but I'd like to stay a little longer.
I hope everyone back home is well.
The buildings in Hamelin are packed tightly together, but there's always back alleys. That's where the Black Market can be found.
Since the national dress code was abolished, the city's craftsmen here have been coming up with all kinds of jewelry and accessories.
In the bad old days, they would carve decorative designs inside people's helmets. Looking back, I suppose the law forced them to be creative.
I saw them... Fish... They were walking... Fish with legs. It must have been a dream...mustn't it?
She's my number one student. One day, her discoveries will change the world, you mark my words.
She's my number one student. She has ideas that I could never hope to come up with.
She's my number one student, and she always looks after of her poor old teacher.
Ah, I was truly blessed to have such a fine student.
Most of the buildings you see here were designed to move. But you'll never see them collide!
The secrets of Hamelin's mechanical wizardry have long been passed faithfully from one generation to the next.
Oh, I say! I'd almost forgotten what people looked like without a pig mask on.
Well, apart from the Prince's servant, of course. He never wore one.
Now that no one's wearing masks, you have to try to remember everyone's face. It's tough!
I had the strangest dream. We'd all been turned into hideous creatures. Ah, it made me long for the good old days of pig masks.
This is a fine suit of armor.<NL>It's got nice padding round the waist.
Ah, not having to wear that bulky armor has really helped relieve my constant backache.
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! I slipped and bruised my back.
I went to see the doctor, and you'll never guess what he recommended wearing! A good suit of armor!
The Tombstone Trail serves as the line that divides the continent of Autumnia in two.
It's such a steep path that only the boldest or most foolhardy souls would even set foot on it.
What did we just see? Did the ghosts of the Tombstone Trail pay us a surprise visit?
Someone told me that the roof covering our city is not just to keep the rain off...
But they didn't tell me what else it was protecting us from. Your guess is as good as mine.
You know, life's taught me that no matter how sturdy a fortress you build, you're never completely safe.
I've seen a fair few places, but nowhere that was half as developed as Hamelin!
These rails on the road require regular inspections, you know.
If you don't replace the parts regularly, buildings start crashing.
I'm trying to get black truffles to grow in my back garden.
If all goes to plan, I'll be able to gorge myself on those delightful morsels morning, noon, and night!
So I managed to grow myself some truffles, but then I ate them all in a single sitting.
I can still taste them now... Oh, that delicate flavor... That lingering aroma...
I saw a swimsuit for sale in the Black Market. And funnily enough, it looked exactly like the one I ordered.
Well, my order hasn't been delivered yet. Maybe I'll just buy that one in the Black Market.
It's so good to be free of the tyranny of armor!<NL>We can wear whatever we fancy!
I'm thinking...swimsuit. That's a good look, right?
Ah, I woke from the most delightful dream. I was running across a beach, the sand under my feet, the wind in my hair...
The only problem was that I was a dog.<NL>What can it all mean?
Ah, I noticed you admiring my trotter-themed footwear... They've got steel toe caps so it doesn't hurt if you drop something on them.
Pretty clever, don't you think?
Did you like Hamelin's array of armor? I had a soft spot for it, I must confess. The law's changed, but I'm still wearing mine to work.
I like this armor. It means I never have to worry about what I'm going to wear.
So my wife said I looked better with my helmet on. I'm not sure what to make of that...
Ah, you look like you've seen a bit of the world. I'd like to hear about your adventures some time.
I hope you enjoy your time here in Hamelin.
This world's an unpredictable place. Mind how you go, won't you?
I shall pray for your safety, Your Highness.
It's not just for processions, you know. Sometimes they shift the streets about just because they can.
They say the location of the Black Market changes every time. I wonder where it is now.
I daresay the Prince will reveal his face at the next royal procession. Oooh, I can hardly wait.
Goodness! Our prince is a handsome chap, isn't he? I swear I can see his father's likeness in him.
Don't worry, I made sure I turned all the lights out before I left the house.
Oh, my dear! I don't think I've ever been quite this excited!
Be patient, I told you! You're so frail and feeble that it's best to stay wrapped up in that armor.
I wonder if we shall have to keep wearing this armor forever.
Be patient, I told you! It's tough for your old grandmother too! The soles of my feet are itchy, but what can I do about it?
Hm... Perhaps it's finally time to shed this armor and hang it at the back of the wardrobe.
It seems such a waste to throw if out, somehow.
The plains around Hamelin are hopping with jackrabbots. They don't mean any harm, so go easy on them.
Ah, things are really changing. We no longer have to spend half the day trying to memorize all the new rules and regulations.
Ah, it's nice to see our soldiers treating young people with respect for a change.
Well, it looks like everything's going swimmingly for you. I'm happy to see it.
The thing is, wearing this armor gives me lots of nice nooks and crannies to conceal things in.
People are always telling me to calm down and stop being so aggressive. But the way I see it, a little head butt never killed anyone...
In Hamelin, we don't compete with one another. We all work together for the greater good of the Empire.
So I've heard they're going to be reorganizing one of the city's residential areas to make room for some new buildings.
Perhaps you don't need to go back to Ding Dong Dell after all... Would you consider settling down here?
It'd be nice to have a man about the house...
We may share the same continent, but there's no contact between Hamelin and Perdida. It's such a shame.
I hope those folks in Perdida are all right. Well, no news is good news, as they say. Though we don't hear much news from them at the best of times...
Ah, I can tell from your eyes that you love machines as well! Well, Hamelin's the place for you!
They say there's a whole host of new shops opening soon. It's sure to make for a livelier atmosphere.
Was that...snow?<NL>But...Hamelin's covered by a huge roof!
So if they ever pass a law forcing dogs to wear armor, my plan is to keep my little darling inside my own suit of armor.
Ah, I feel so light! I'm going to go for a nice long walk, without any clanking or squeaking!
My little darling suddenly started barking, and raced off down the main street.
I'm just glad he came back in one piece!
You don't get many foreign goods coming into Hamelin these days. You can't find a babana for love nor money.
I think it's time my poor mother took off that heavy armor. Mother! Come on now!
Mother! If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times. It is NOT all right to head butt people!
Argh! Curse these stupid outfits! They call us Hamelin Hogs behind our backs, you know!
Ohhh, I can't get over how dashing my man looks without his pig armor on!
It's so hard to find nice makeup in the shops these days. I suppose no one really buys it anymore.
Being stuck in a sweaty suit of armor at least stops you putting on weight!
Hm. That strange white stuff didn't look like it would be very good for your skin.
Grandma! This armor's all horrible and hot and sweaty!
Grandma! My back's all itchy and horrible!
Grandma! My armor smells funny!
When I grow up, I'm going to become an explorer and write about all my adventures.
That way, I'll have all sorts of death-defying tales of derring-do, just like the Taskmaster at Swift Solutions.
I'm going to set sail for distant lands, weather fierce storms, take on giant jellyfish, battle terrifying tanks... Hey! What are you laughing at?
Just what's going on out there?
Guards wear different helmets to normal folks.<NL>I want to wear one when I grow up.
Hey! The soldiers aren't wearing helmets anymore! I wonder if I could have their old ones.
Why do the guards keep bowing when you're around?
They must think you're royalty or something. But I know you're not, because if you were, you'd ride around on a big train like the Emperor.
You outsiders might think us strict, but our rules keep the masses in line, and our armor keeps them safe. Ask any loyal citizen, and they'll tell you they're happy.
It's true what people are saying—Prince Marcassin is like a new man. He's starting to remind me of his father, and there's no higher praise than that.
Your Highness!<NL>It is an honor!
Your bravery is an example to us all!
Article 2678 of the constitution requires that all armor be sparkling at all times...
It's just a shame polish is so expensive...
So it seems we'll have fewer rules and regulations to memorize. What a relief!
I'd started muddling them up. One morning, I couldn't remember whether I was meant to be putting on my gloves or my helmet first...
Everyone in the Empire is praying for your success.
May victory be yours!
You know, I don't think I've been much of a husband to my poor wife of late. I need to buck up my ideas.
I asked my dear wife if she'd join me on a little promenade. I've actually got butterflies in my stomach.
My dear wife was indoors when it all happened. She was spared the horrors of that...that...vision, or whatever it was...
I'm so happy she's safe and well.
There are laws forbidding possession of all manner of luxury goods, but you can still get them if you know where to look.
There's a certain shop down a back alley I know. I wonder what it's got in stock right now...
There used to be so much small print on official forms in Hamelin that I needed a magnifying glass to read them.
If you see something you want, it's best to stock up. You never know when an item's going to disappear from the shelves.
A helmet is like a little steam room for the face. Breathing can be a problem, but it does wonders for the skin!
What was that white powder? I remember staring at it, then my head began to hurt...
Now my skin's all dry, and I've got big bags under my eyes. What a trial this has been!
Master! I bought lots of grease! It's perfect for stopping cogs getting rusty!
Master! I brought back a bunch of rabbots and jackrabbots. We seem to get along famously.
I'm thinking of taking them on as my apprentices!
Master! Are you all right!?
...Master!!!
You're wondering why I'm letting you through?<NL>Well, that fellow you're with shared some rather juicy gossip with me.
In exchange for which, I've decided to let you pass.
Do not fear! We will do all in our power to protect Hamelin!
It is our sworn duty to protect Hamelin!
I heard what you did. You have my gratitude. I wish you well.
We would lay down our lives to protect our prince.
In his wisdom, the Prince has created a magic circle here which allows one to travel elsewhere in an instant.
Set foot within it and you will be sent to the city's entrance in a flash.
This is a magic circle that allows one to travel instantaneously to the main street.
Should you ever wish to visit the palace, you will find it most useful.

I'll tell you what we need by here, Ollie-Boy—a bridge, en't it!?
I'll tell you what, Ollie-boy, a bridge across there would be proper handy...
Oh my, look at that river of lava!<NL>Hey, don't you know a spell which could get us across, Oliver?
Crikey! There's a huge great big river of lava by here, mun! And no way to cross it, either...
Come on then, Ollie-boy! Get youer wand out and whip us up a bridge!
Look, the Tombstone Trail's just over there!<NL>Come on Oliver, draw some runes and get us across!
Look at them ancient ruins by there! Come on, Ollie-boy, start drawing some runes and get us across!
Look, mun! There's another one of them massive great big pictures on the ground by here. It's a bit faded, like, but I reckon a quick spell might bring it back...
Come on, Oliver.<NL>Let's have a look around the island!
...So that was Shadar, huh?<NL>And we couldn't beat him...
Beat him? We never stood a chance...<NL>We'll have to do a damn sight better than that next time.
In fact, we're going to have to go <color:#1>All-Out</color>.
All-Out...?
Yeah. Going <color:#1>All-Out</color> is a good way to change your tactics when you spot an opportunity or get into trouble during<NL>a fight.
Press [btn_tri] to switch to <color:#1>All-Out Attack</color>, and [btn_squ] to switch to <color:#1>All-Out Defense</color>.
That should make things a little easier.<NL>Maybe you do know a thing or two after all...
'Course I do. The old man was a pretty strict teach— Ah! Erm... Right, let's go!
I'm telling you, mun, this en't a good idea...
Weeell!<NL>Well, well, well...!
Oh, knickers!<NL>This won't be pretty...
Huh? Wh-What's...?
Well if it en't my little Drippy! Where have you been, then? Off gallivanting, I bet, without a word to youer old mam the whole time. You'll be the death of me, you will...
M-Mr. Drippy?<NL>I-I think she's talking to you...
Can't be, mun. I've no idea who she is.
Awww, there's cruel! Why you back, anyway, Drippy? Find that human you were looking for, did you? S'posed to be some sage or something, wasn't it?
No, mun! All right?<NL>I haven't found her yet!
Don't you "mun" me! You'd have found her ages ago if you weren't such a lazy beggar. And after all I did for you— Ooh! Hello there! Who's that you've got with you, then?
...Huh? Oh, um... Are you talking to me, Ma'am?
Proper little gentleman this one, en't it? Oh but look at the state I'm in! I've just woken up, mun! Why didn't you tell me we had visitors, Drippy-boy!?
Come on, Ollie-boy!<NL>Leg it!
Here, you've got a map, haven't you? Well, take a look at the top right-hand corner. I've marked it for you, en't it? That's where I am, see? Come and see me, all right?
I'm sorry, Ma'am, we have to go now...
Chop-chop, mun!
My sincerest apologies. The repairs will take a little longer. Why not stretch your legs on dry land for a while?
Captain Sindbah!
Oliver!? Thank goodness! Tell me that you at least found somewhere to shelter at night...
We sure did! And we brought a ton of food, too!<NL>There's a little village on the island, and—
A village, you say? And food, also... I am pleased to learn this. And you will be pleased to learn that my men have completed their repairs to the ship.
She is ready to sail upon your command!<NL>Shall I give the order to weigh anchor?
Uhh... Yes. Yes please.
Hm? You are troubled, I feel.<NL>Have you left something behind in the forest?
...No. No, we're ready to go!
Very well! We sail!
Um... Would you mind waiting just a little while?
Forgive me. I thought you were anxious to depart.<NL>My ship and I are at your disposal.<NL>When you are ready, we sail!
The Sea Cow is fully repaired and ready to sail upon your command. Shall I raise the anchor?
'Ning to you! You cannot be entering without the permission of the elder of the village of <color:#1>Yule</color>, yes?
You do not know of where I am speaking?<NL>Go simply south, yes?
'Ning to you! I am having been told by the elder of the village to let you pass. It is very cold inside. Be careful not to freeze into ice, yes?
The gate's locked. Looks like we can't get in.
Not that we have any reason to be here...
Oh. The gate's locked. It seems we can't get in.
...Unless there's an entrance on the other side. Come on, Oliver! Let's have a look!
It appears to be securely locked.
Huh? What's this blue crab doing all the way out here?
He's that other crab's friend, en't he?<NL>The one from Castaway Cove!
Use that <color:#1>spell</color> of youers on him and see what he's got to say, mun!
Good idea, Mr. Drippy!
Ahhh...this is the life! Plenty of food, gently lapping waves... It's a crab's paradise!
'Course, that's not what I thought when I first washed up here. I was convinced I was going to end up living like<NL>a hermit...
But this place is so much more relaxing than Castaway Cove. I've really come out my shell, y'know—and I'm never going back!
So you used to live in Castaway Cove, huh?<NL>Were you friends with another blue crab who lives there?
Wh-What!? Pinch me if I'm dreaming but...<NL>Can you really understand what I'm saying!?
And how do you know about my friend?<NL>The one who lives in Castaway Cove?
Your friend asked us to look for you, Mister.<NL>He was real worried, see, and wanted to know<NL>you were okay.
He... He was really worried? I see...
Hey! Could you give him a message for me?<NL>Something like...
"I'm having a great time out here! There's loads of food, and the weather's cracking! Scuttle over and join<NL>me soon!"
All right, I'll tell him!<NL>He sure will be happy when he hears you're okay!
Thank you, young man! I'd shake you by the claw if I were a little taller.
.........
Thanks for your help, young man!
You've driven away two pirate ships!<NL>Two ships remain!
You've driven away a pirate ship!<NL>Three ships remain!
You've driven away three pirate ships!<NL>One ship remains!
All the pirate ships have been driven away!
Hey, look! This seagull has a swimsuit in its mouth!
Well spotted, mun! It must be the pesky bird that's been tormenting Castaway Cove!
It must be, huh...<NL>Do you think he'll give it back to us?
Well there's only one way to find out, en't it, Ollie-boy! Get youer wand out and have a word, like!
Ahhh... What pretty colours...such soft fabrics...<NL>But...how do I wear it?
Excuse me, Mr. Seagull—would you mind giving that swimsuit back to us?
W-Wow! How can you...?<NL>You can understand what I'm saying!
Every word, you feathered felon!<NL>Now hand over that costume you pinched!
That bikini by there is a valuable piece of swimwear, as worn by a beautiful princess!
Wasted on the likes of you, it is.<NL>You don't even know what to do with it, mun!
All right, all right, there's no need to get into a flap about it! How was I meant to know it was so precious?
Well, anyway...I suppose it's only fair that I give it back. Here, take it.
Really!? Gee, thanks, Mr. Seagull!
Wait till the flock hear that I've been talking to humans. It'll be a real feather in my cap!
Look at this size of that, mun!<NL>What the flipping heck is it!?
It must be the monster that stole those Cat's Whiskers,<NL>Mr. Drippy! We have to get them back—and fast!
Right you are, Ollie-boy! All set, is it?
Hmm... There's something fishy about this fellow by here... This must be ouer thief!
Are you sure, Mr. Drippy...?
There en't no time to call for flipping witnesses, mun! Action's what's needed! You ready for some, Ollie-boy?
...Aha! Inspector Drippy does it again!<NL>This fellow by here's ouer culprit, I'm sure of it!
Well...if you're sure...
I've never been this sure in my life, mun!<NL>Now, are you ready to administer some justice, or what?
Right you are, then. Let's go!
Come on, Ollie-boy! The gatekeeper's counting on us, mun. We've got to get those Cat's Whiskers back to him.
Fight the whisker thief?
You've recovered the Cat's Whiskers!
There is no sign of the Cat's Whiskers.<NL>It seems that the creature was innocent...
The footprints lead off to the west...
The footprints lead off to the northwest...
The footprints lead off to the southeast...<NL>They seem relatively fresh.
The footprints lead off to the north...<NL>They look fresh!
The footprints lead off to the north...
The footprints lead off to the north...<NL>They seem relatively fresh.
...Huh? Hey look, Mr. Drippy!
These footprints are different from the ones we saw in Ding Dong Dell!
Don't be daft, Ollie-boy!<NL>I'm pretty sure I would have noticed if...
Oh, knickers. We've been following the wrong blinking trail, mun!
The footprints lead off to the southwest...<NL>They seem relatively fresh.
The footprints lead off to the south...<NL>They look fresh!
Wow. A fairy in a place like this...?
Hey! You must be one of the Golden Grove fairies, right?
Nah, mun! Not I! Well...okay, yeah... But not anymore! There's no way I'm going back to that horrible forest by there!
Calm down, will you, mun? It's all sorted now. Me and Ollie-boy by here have restored peace to Golden Grove, see.
D-Drippy!? Is it really you, mun!?
That's right, boyo—Lord High Lord to you, though, en't it!? Now then, look sharp. Youer butties are waiting<NL>for you.
Really? Tidy! I can't believe it, mun! Over the moon, I am! I s'pose I'd better head off then, is it?
Yeah! Don't worry, we'll come with you.
Huh? There's some kind of writing on this stone...
I wonder what it says...
What's this stone over by here, then? Some kind of writing on it, too. Now, what does this say...?
"Tiny Tim's Treasure
"We managed to get our mitts on the treasure, but we suffered for it. Most of the crew were still wearing their swimwear from Castaway Cove, and caught awful colds.
"It's a miracle no one froze to death. We probably only survived because we wrapped ourselves in our<NL>beach towels.
"If we ever come here again, we're wearing the biggest, thickest woolen clothes we can find.
"—A Castaway Corsair"<NL>[nz_1] [nz_k]
This must be one of the places marked on the treasure map, huh?
Hmm... Yeah, must be, eh? Honestly! What kind of idiot takes to the high seas in nothing but swimming trunks, I ask you?
"Treasure in the Barrens
"Finding this treasure was no mean feat, I assure you.
"No matter where we looked or where we dug, we could find no trace of the blasted thing.
"Only after we had reduced the entire coastline to an unsightly collection of holes and hillocks did we finally find a little chest...
"...with a single gold coin inside it. To say that the Captain was furious would be an understatement...
"—A Castaway Corsair"<NL>[nz_5] [nz_a]
Sounds about right. One gold coin, eh?<NL>I'd be flipping gutted!
"A Discovery on Swan Island
"Not only does Swan Island look like a bird, it's actually covered in the things, all living happily alongside<NL>one another.
"They didn't like it when the Captain started digging for treasure, though. Huge flocks of them started pecking at him all at once...
"They probably thought he was after their eggs. I'll never forget the captain trudging back to the ship, muttering about 'blasted birds' and 'roasting them all'...
"—A Castaway Corsair"<NL>[nz_4] [nz_l]
Probably, yeah. I quite like this captain's style,<NL>I've got to say...
"The Bounty of Bungler's Bay
"No sooner had we uncovered a buried treasure chest than the Captain lost his balance on deck and fell into the sea, taking the chest and its contents with him...
"We managed to haul the Captain aboard uninjured, but the chest sank to the bottom of the sea... And to think he is the one always telling us to watch our step...
"—A Castaway Corsair"<NL>[nz_7] [nz_3]
It looks like it. Crikey, I thought the Captain was a goner there, mun...
What's this stone over by here, then? Some kind of writing on it, too. Now, what does this say...
"Scavenging on the Shipwreck Shore
"The tides have washed all sorts of things onto the Shipwreck Shore beach.
"Just as we landed, in fact, we saw that a wrecked pirate ship had been lifted onto the sand.
"Upon closer inspection, it turned out to have been full to the gunwales with treasure! These are the days about which every pirate dreams...
"—A Castaway Corsair"<NL>[nz_3] [nz_b]
Yeah, I reckon. But never mind that, Ollie-boy!<NL>Look around!
There's shipwrecks aplenty round by here! Let's go and see if there's any leftover treasure to be had!
"The Booty of Billy Goat's Bluff
"Climbing the hills from the bay where we landed was a long, hard slog, but at least the treasure was where it was supposed to be for once.
"I just can't wait to get back to sea. I start to feel sick if I spend too long on dry land.
"The Captain seems to be faring even worse. I've caught him rocking from side to side and muttering 'the sea...the sea...' more than once now...
"If we don't get back to the boat soon, I fear we'll have to carry him.
"—A Castaway Corsair"<NL>[nz_6] [nz_i]
En't it, though. I'm a bit surprised that these pirate types would come this far inland in search of treasure, mind...
"Treasure in No Longer Mine
"It's quite rare for the Captain to find the treasure we're looking for as soon as we land, but that's what happened this time.
"His face was a real picture—I've never seen him look so proud of himself.
"I was happy that he'd found the treasure and all, but he didn't have to look quite so smug about it...
"—A Castaway Corsair"<NL>[nz_2] [nz_v]
Yeah, it looks that way...
You know, I can just imagine that old captain grinning like a Cheshire cat...
But it's all blurry.<NL>I can't read what it says...
It's another monument!
It is, too. The words on it are all faded though, eh. Can't make head nor tail of them...
Do you think it's something to do with Kublai's great-great-great grandfather's most valuable treasure? The one he told us about?
It must be! Hey, if we use <color:#1>magic</color>, we can probably make it so that we can read the words, huh?
Go on then, give it a go!
Neato! The writing's just like new!
Nice work, Ollie-boy! Right then, let's have a read, shall we?
"The Greatest Treasure of All
"They say that life is an adventure.
"And so it has proved for us. Braving terrible storms and giant waves, we have explored every corner of this wondrous world.
"We've seen such sights as no man could imagine, felt cold that chilled the blood, and heat that singed the skin...
"We've amassed countless treasures, and spent just as many, bested countless foes, and paid victory's<NL>heavy price...
"But finally, our journey is at an end. After all this time and all this traveling, I have discovered the greatest treasure of all:
"A life spent with friends.
"To this, no worldly wealth can compare.
"As a tribute to the times my friends and I shared, I have made records of my dearest memories and placed them around the world we explored together.
"I hope that one day, another adventurer will find them, and will discover the value of companionship on one's journeys.
"Here Lies Kublai Khan, the Third of That Name,<NL>Captain of the Indomitable Spirit."
So it's a grave, is it?
I guess so... Gee, it sure sounds like Kublai's great-great-great grandfather had a fun life.
So the time you spend with youer friends is the greatest treasure in the whole world... That's a bit...pretentious, en't it?
Huh!? W-Well, I think I kinda get what he's saying, though... I mean, my memories of traveling around this world with you guys...they're the best I have.
Yeah, but—Ah, Ollie-boy... That's... It's really... Ahem! Crikey—it's flipping boring by here, en't it!? Let's get back to Castaway Cove, shall we?
Wonderful! Such ferocious fighting!<NL>I never dreamed I could observe it firsthand!
Oi! What are you doing by here!?<NL>How long have you been watching for?
I think you'll find I've been here since the very beginning! I correctly surmised that monitoring your methodology would be advantageous to my studies.
Now, my next research subject is the <color:#1>auric collum</color>, which resides atop the <color:#1>Genie's Steps</color> to the southeast of the <color:#1>Shimmering Sands</color>.
An auric collum? That sounds kinda special...
Indeed. If my sources are to be believed, the body of this mysterious creature glows with a majestic golden hue.
...Alas, I must return to Ding Dong Dell to put the data I've just collected in order.
Should you have any questions, I think you'll find<NL>me there.
All right, let's head for the <color:#1>Genie's Steps</color>, southeast of the <color:#1>Shimmering Sands</color>!
Excellent! Yet more data for me to pore over.<NL>...And another fine example of nature's formidable power.
Why, I was so taken by the grace on display that I very nearly neglected to take the necessary notes! I jest, of course—there was never any danger of that.
Now then, the last creature I require you to hunt is the <color:#1>shellmet</color>. I think you'll find it on the island of <color:#1>No Longer Mine</color>, to the <color:#1>south of Autumnia</color>.
Its sharp spike and highly durable shell make it one of the deadliest creatures known to science.
One of the deadliest creatures known to science...?<NL>...Is this really such a great idea?
Oh, come on, mun! You can't go letting a lethal spike and a bit of impenetrable armor put you off. Besides, you'll have youers truly to help you, en't it!?
Now it was the island of <color:#1>No Longer Mine</color>, to the <color:#1>south of Autumnia</color>, was it? Chop-chop, then, let's get moving!
Impressive work!
I knew I'd made the right choice in entrusting this research to you!
Gee, thanks! So you got your, uh, data?
I certainly did! Thank you, young man.
The data you have helped me to collect is about to revolutionize the natural sciences!
Well, that sounds just swell, I guess...<NL>Good luck with all your research, Derwin!
I shan't be requiring luck! Oh... Here is a little something for your trouble. I think you'll find it adequate recompense.
Now, I must get back to Ding Dong Dell and start processing this data!
...H-He's gone already!
Always shooting off somewhere, that one. I tell you, these creature researching types are helluva peculiar...
GRRRRRR!
Here we go, Ollie-boy!
Crikey! Is this that <color:#1>grubby fug</color> Derwin was going on about!? Looks a bit blooming feisty to me...
But we can't run away, Mr. Drippy!<NL>We promised Derwin!
NGGGHHHAAA!
Knickers! Here goes nothing!
It's an <color:#1>auric collum</color>!<NL>Flipping heck...it's got arms like tree-trunks!
Come on, Mr. Drippy! We can beat it, I just know we can!
BWAAARRRGGGHHH!
Let's do this!
H-Here it c-comes, mun!<NL>A <color:#1>shellmet</color>!
We've come this far, Mr. Drippy!<NL>We can't give up now!
Hey, there's something on the ground over here...
That's a diary, that is. I bet it's the one that old posho said he'd lost.
You're right! Come on, let's take it back to him!
Hey, I wonder if this is—
That old duffer's diary!<NL>It's a bit burned around the edges, mind...
Well...I'm sure he'll still be glad we found it.<NL>Let's take it back to him, Mr. Drippy.
Look, Mr. Drippy!<NL>It's that gentleman's diary!
What the heck was he thinking, hanging about on these tracks by here...?
It sure is lucky we found it, huh?<NL>Come on, let's go give it back.
Hey, look!<NL>It's that gentleman's diary!
Doddery old codger must have had a nap here and left it behind, I reckon.
Well, he does seem kinda forgetful...<NL>Anyway, we should take it back to him!
Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to claim your reward!
Look over by here, Ollie-boy!<NL>It's another one of them blinking rifts!
I wish they'd give it a flipping rest!
I'm famous for my patience, me, but even the Lord High Lord of the Fairies has his limits—and these things are getting on my wick! I've a good mind to leave them to it!
Mr. Drippy! You shouldn't say things like that!<NL>We have to do something!
All right, mun, keep youer hair on.<NL>I was only joking, en't it!?
Just a little fairy gag, like...<NL>Up for another scrap, are you?
Careful, Ollie-boy!<NL>I've got a bad feeling about this one!
Eh? Hitting back with one of youer human jokes, is it?<NL>Nah, mun. I don't get it...
Examine the black orb?
Oh, you are having a laugh, mun!<NL>There's a rift all the way out here!?
No matter how many of these flipping things we patch up, there always seems to be another one! I'm getting sick of the sight of them, mun!
Still, I s'pose we can't just walk away from it, like.
What do you reckon, Ollie-boy?
Hold on tight, then!<NL>I reckon we're in for a right tidy fight this time!
I just dread to think what'll happen if we leave it to its own devices, see...
Wow! We're back in your world, Mr. Drippy!
Look, Ollie-boy! Someone's stuck a letter to this car by here. Under the wiper, see?
A-A letter!?
Whoa...!<NL>H-How did Phil's car...our car...?
You can sort out the whys and hows later, mun.<NL>This is youer dream, en't it? Hop in, Ollie-boy!
Look, Ollie-boy!<NL>It's one of them magimech masters!
It's a magimech master!<NL>Are you ready for this, Ollie-boy?
Watch out, Ollie-boy!<NL>There's a great big magimech master by there!
THUNK! TZZZK... DNGGGHHHHHH!
Phew... Looks like we got him.<NL>Right, on to the next one, is it?
Two down, one to go!<NL>Keep it up, Ollie-boy!
We did it! We thrashed the lot of 'em!
Good job, too—I was starting to get fed up of whacking their rock-hard hides. Right then, back to the Ivory Tower!
We're monster fodder if we stand around like this, Ollie-boy! Let's get a move on!
What's the matter? Never seen a castle before?
Let's head for the castle, Ollie-boy!<NL>There'll be plenty of time for chatting once we get there!
You're doing well, Ollie-boy.<NL>You'll feel at home here in no time flat!
Remember to save regularly, en't it!?
Go on, mun! Use the right stick to have a look around!
Finding the Deep Dark Wood's easy, mun!<NL>Just head north from Ding Dong Dell till you see a load of trees!
Hmm, en't seen the Old Man of the Woods for a while... I wonder how he's getting on...
Press [btn_r1] to take a gander at the local map, Ollie-boy!
This way, mun! This way!
You lost or something?<NL>Can't see youer way for the tears, is it?
If there's ever anything you want to know more about, I'm sure the Telling Stone would love to answer all youer questions!
Come on, mun! Use the Locket to help that brokenhearted guard!
Chop-chop, then, Ollie-boy!<NL>Back to Ding Dong Dell to mend that guard's broken heart!
We've got to get down to Ding Dong Dell, mun!
Pah! We finally get into Ding Dong Dell, and you come all the way back here! What are you thinking, mun?
Oi, you planning on standing out like a sore flipping thumb forever, mun? You need a new outfit, and I don't mean tomorrow...
Swift Solutions, we need. Does it look like we're going to find it here? Does it? Well, does it? I'll give you a hint—NO!
The Cat's Cradle's just there as you go into Ding Dong Dell, mun. What are we doing all the way out by here?
Come on, mun! Let's go and pick up youer new outfit! I can't wait to see what the old girl's thrown together for you...
All we need to do is head down to the palace in Ding Dong Dell. That should be easy enough, even for you!
We need to find that red herring sharpish, mun! Don't want it flipping and flopping all the way to the ocean now, do we?
Now we've caught the flipping thing, can we please hurry up and deliver it?
Who exactly were you planning on getting some enthusiasm off round by here then, hm?
Oi, Ollie-boy! Aren't we s'posed to be on the hunt for someone with enthusiasm to spare?
Planning on delivering that enthusiasm we found any time this century, are you?
Right, enough of the sightseeing! Let's get ouerselves down to the Cawtermaster's Stores, shall we?
Shouldn't we be over by the palace in Ding Dong Dell getting ouerselves a new wand?
We've got to go over to youer world to find out what's wrong over by here!
We're not going to find Timmy round by here, are we, now?
Where do you think youer going, hm?<NL>What about old Timmy-boy?
Reckon youer going to find him round here, do you? I flipping don't!
To Ding Dong Dell, and down Ding Dong Well! That's where we need to be going, mun!
We finally get it open, and you come running off over by here! Youer a funny one, Ollie-boy, and no mistake...
What's the matter with you, eh?<NL>Shouldn't you be looking for the King?
Rashaad is one of the Great Sages, just like Alicia!<NL>I can't wait to see what he can do!
Have you stocked up on bread, Ollie-boy? I know this place that does one loaf for twenty guilders, or ten for two-hundred! Sounds like a bargain to me!
Be sure to pick up any shiny things you see when you're wandering around. Foraging, that's called!
Right, so it's south through Golden Grove, and then straight on to Al Mamoon! Wake me up when we get there, eh?
The best place to forage for an item is somewhere where you've found it before, en't it!?
After Golden Grove, it's on to Al Mamoon!
Oi! En't you s'posed to be restoring the Spring of Life to its former glory?
Some of these sand monsters are proper nasty.<NL>There's no shame in running away, all right?
It's going to take a tidy while to get the whole forest back to its former glory, en't it...?
Block youer enemies' attacks and give them a good thwack on the counter. That's the best way to get glims, mun!
En't we s'posed to be going and meeting that Rashaad bloke?
Come on, Ollie-boy! Let's get over to youer world!
Get a move on! We've got to help Rusty, en't it!?
Haven't you got something you need to tell Myrtle?
Let's get ouer bottoms in gear and get back to Al Mamoon, shall we?
Learned a new spell, is it, Ollie-boy?<NL>Proper little wizard youer becoming, mun!
The Temple of Trials is in the north part of the Shimmering Sands. Got that?
You ever stayed at the Cat's Cradle in Al Mamoon, Ollie-boy? You should, mun. They're always giving stuff away down by there...
What kind of trials have they got at this temple, then?
Where was Rashaad sleeping, then?<NL>Not that I'm bothered or anything...
I slept like a flipping log, mun! Tidy!<NL>I must've been proper knackered...
What's wrong with you, mun?<NL>We need to go and see the Supreme Sage, en't it?
We're going nowhere fast until we pass those Trials, mun.
Come on, mun! Let's get down to the Temple and take that third Trial!
The Supreme Sage is waiting for us, en't he?
I know Solomon said to take a break, but that's no reason to go running off flipping miles away now, is it, mun?
You do realize youer familiars don't get any battle experience while they're stuck in that sewer, don't you?
Well, I had a proper tidy time there, Ollie-boy!<NL>Glad I was just watching, mind...
That test of friendship looked like fun.<NL>Reckon we'd pass it, Ollie-boy?
Look after youer familiars properly and eventually they'll metamorphose! Sounds proper tidy, doesn't it?
You can change youer familiars' names when they metamorphose, so don't worry too much if you give them a stinker first time round!
As soon as you see that heart mark, it's time for Esther to take over and start serenading!
We'll never stop that volcano from erupting if we don't get a flipping move on!
I can't flipping believe it, mun! You stopped that volcano erupting! I always had faith in you, Ollie-boy. Didn't I always tell you I had faith in you?
That Great Sage Rashaad's going to have the shock of his life when he hears what we've been up to, mun!
We did it! We did it, mun!<NL>I feel like a proper hero, I do!
Right then, Castaway Cove it is!<NL>That's south from Al Mamoon, en't it!?
The stronger you are, Ollie-boy, the easier it is to get creatures to join you.
A ship!? Tidy! Now this feels like a proper adventure!
We need to get after that dirty rotten thief, en't it?
Just going to let that stinking thief run off with the pot, are we?
Oi! Where are you off to, eh? The magic words for that pot are in the flipping Wizard's Companion, mun!
Come on, mun! Let's get down to Castaway Cove and set sail on the high seas!
Back to Al Mamoon again, is it...?
That so-called sage Rashaad could have told us about needing permission, mun...
Back to Al Mamoon!? But I just got changed into my trunks, mun!
We need to get the queen of Al Mamoon to give us permission to borrow her boat, en't it?
Fancy taking a look at the Cat's Cradle they've got over in Al-Mamoon? I hear it's a proper snazzy one.
Let's get over to youer world, shall we?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, en't there?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, mun!
Shift it, mun! Let's get back to Al Mamoon!
We need to head over to Al Mamoon and find us some restraint, mun!
Don't you like Al Mamoon or something?<NL>We need to head back there, mun!
Let's go and give old Cowface her restraint back, shall we?
I wonder why she's got that portrait?<NL>Reckon they're selling them somewhere, Ollie-boy?
So the Cowlipha gave you a spell that makes things heavier, did she? Bet she knows a thing or two about that, en't it!?
Finally, Ollie-boy! Finally we get to sail the ocean wave!
Oi! We need to get back to Castaway Cove and retrieve ouer stolen goods!
Come on, mun! We need to go down to Castaway Cove and find us some restraint!
Let's go and hand over that restraint we got ouerselves, shall we?
That boat's going to leave without us if we don't get a flipping move on! Castaway Cove, and don't spare the ulks!
All aboard! Let's go and hit the high seas, en't it!
Hamelin is in Autumnia, en't it? Have a look at the map if you don't know where that is!
Don't go getting seasick on me, boyo!
There's nothing better than a proper cruise, en't it?<NL>Have a look at these lapping waves, mun. Soothe youer very soul, they do.
Don't s'pose I could stay by here and help with the repairs, could I?
Ollie-boy...help me... I'm sick... Got a severe case of can'tgoanyfurtheritis, I have...
Come on, mun. Why don't we just sit here for a bit instead of having to be on the move all the flipping time?
Oh knickers... They're going to find me, they are.<NL>I know it...
Hey, Ollie-boy, the repairs should be just about finished, I reckon. Shall we pop back to the ship for a look, like?
Autumnia must be helluva near... I reckon we can swim it, mun! Come on, Ollie-boy! Get youer trunks on!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
...Eh?<NL>Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.
We need to go and give those boys their pieces of art back, en't it.
S'pose we'd better go and make my mam laugh, eh?
Come on, mun! We need to get inside my mam, en't it?
We've got some unfinished business back inside my mam, mun!
Looks like my mam gave you some tidy spells by there, Ollie-boy. Some of them are so tidy, you can't even use them!
You'd regret leaving me behind, mun. Tidy in a tight spot I am, I'm telling you.
See that jump I did to get back on the ship, Ollie-boy?<NL>Perfect execution from start to finish!
Right then, let's try and make it to Hamelin this time, en't it? You know where it is, don't you?
Don't leave me behind again, will you? That jump was a proper one-off!
Let's hurry up and get ouerselves to Hamelin, shall we?
D'you see any sages round by here?<NL>I flipping don't!
Reckon youer going to get some Hamelin armor round by here, do you? Well I flipping don't!
Oi, what do you think youer doing, ditching youer piggy armor and running off?
What exactly does this have to do with sneaking ouer way into the palace in Hamelin, hm?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
Gone back in time, have we?<NL>Must have been that peculiar mist...
Seems pretty harsh, like.<NL>Looks like it's down to us to save them, Ollie-boy!
This must be the past, Ollie-boy. Not a suit of piggy armor in sight, see...
That younger lad is the future emperor, en't it?<NL>What happened to his older brother, then?
Them brats don't seem very grateful to me, mun.<NL>Maybe we shouldn't have bothered rescuing them!
Come on, mun! We can't leave these kids by here.<NL>Let's get them back to the palace.
Tombstone Trail, is it?<NL>I don't like the sound of that...
Right then, we need the Mornstar and a time travel spell, in that order. Let's go, Ollie-boy!
That Gascon lad doesn't seem to get on too well with the old emperor, like. Probably one of those republicans, en't it...?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Flipping heck, mun, the legendary wand!<NL>I can feel its power from over by here!
Right then, wave that wand and get us back to ouer time, Ollie-boy! Wait! We'd better head back to Hamelin first, en't it?
Who was that old wizard in the big mask, then?
That Gascon... I thought he was a proper brat at first, but he's not a bad lad, is he?
I can't believe it! No tears or anything from ouer boy Marcassin. And he's just a kid, mun!
Back to Hamelin we go, Ollie-boy!<NL>There's something we've got to do, en't it!?
Let's get some belief off that Marcassin, shall we?
Come on, mun! Let's give Marcassin his belief back!
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
The thing is with hideouts, they're hidden, en't it?<NL>What do you say we have a look at the map before<NL>we start searching?
Solosseum Series, is it? Fancy popping down the Temple of Trials and seeing what it's all about?
The thing is with hideouts, they're hidden, en't it?<NL>What do you say we have a look at the map before we start searching?
Itching to get over to Kublai's hideout, I am!
We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?
Let's hurry up and find that dragon's soul mate, shall we?
Motorville, mun! And make it snappy!
I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface?<NL>He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while<NL>it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going<NL>all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
Come on, Ollie-boy, just one pass over the top of Old Smoky. I bet all that hot air feels proper tidy!
Don't tell me you've forgotten where we're going, mun! Solitary Isle, en't it!? The one marked on the map of the stones!
A quick parp on the dragon horn and Tengri'll come<NL>a-flapping! Just don't go blowing it anywhere stupid,<NL>all right? Else the pooer dab can't land!
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
I wonder what Smiley and Surly are up to...<NL>Heading for Shadar's castle armed only with a slapstick, I bet...
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!
What do you reckon's going on with that soldier from Xanadu over in front of the palace in Hamelin, eh?
So the Great Sage Khulan's somewhere in Autumnia, is she? Tidy!
Let's hop on Tengri and have a look around Autumnia!
Oh! Maybe we'll find her playing the slot machines at the casino... Of course we won't, mun! Keep looking!
Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
It's no wonder they call it holy wood, mun—have you seen it sparkle? There's beautiful!
What are we doing here? We lost the holy wood over by Ding Dong Dell, en't it?
The thief's got to be over by Ding Dong Dell somewhere, mun!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Here, we'd better go and check if Pip's any better hadn't we?
If we don't get that holy wood back, we're going nowhere fast, mun!
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now 'til the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
They're having a party down in Ding Dong Dell, mun! Let's get ouer glad rags on and boogie!
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
So we're going to Nazcaä...<NL>Blinking hard to say, en't it?
Who's this Pea really, then? She's not...is she?
So the ash has stopped falling, is it?<NL>There's handy. The glass in my lantern was starting to look a right state!
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
Did you see that bird, Ollie-boy? Beautiful, it was.
You're not asking me for help again, are you!?
Wahey!
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
What's up with you, eh?
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
Let's start the new day as we mean to go on, shall we? Best foot forward, and last one in's a rotten egg!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
Lay off for a bit, will you? Even us fairies need a bit of time to ouerselves now and again...
Want me to say something, do you? Sorry, mun, I got nothing for you. Not a sausage. Nada. Diddly-squat. Zero. Er...zilch.
You should have a read of youer Wizard's Companion once in a while, mun. It's the wizardly thing to do.
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
Fancy a race, Ollie-boy?<NL>I'm faster than I look, en't it!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
You talking to me or chewing a brick? Sorry, mun. Just wanted to try and sound tough. Pretty convincing, eh?
Flipping heck, mun! Proper wound up, I am!<NL>Come on, let's do something, before I go potty!
Youer not... Ha ha! You are, en't it?<NL>Youer flipping lost! Nice one, Cyril!
No rush, Ollie-boy. Let's take it easy for a bit.
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!
You know, when all this is over, I'm going to miss—erm... Misbehave, mun! Go crazy, I will. Fairy rarebit for breakfast, babana flans all day long...
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
Where shall we start, Ollie-boy?
I wonder what Smiley and Surly are up to... Heading for Shadar's castle armed only with a slapstick, I bet...
That ceremony must be about to start over Perdida way soon, mun. We'd best get a move on!
Righto, let's get over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what-for!
The funny thing is...<NL>Flipping heck! I forgot what I was going to say!
Less chatting, more walking!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Let's crack on, shall we?
I know it's not like me, but I haven't got all that much to say at the minute.
What's up? Sorry, mun, if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm all out of wise words. Got some stupid ones if you fancy those...

(whimper)
Crikey... This dragon looks like he'd lose a fight with a fly, mun! Not like that one we just fought—proper feisty,<NL>he was!
Well, he is sick, Mr. Drippy...
What's up with you then, Tenny-boy?<NL>Wingrot, is it? Touch of hornache?
Kyahhh...
Come on, mun, we can't help you if you just stand there groaning like that!
Uh... I guess he's trying to say something to us.<NL>In, you know...dragon.
You sure, Ollie-boy? Well, if you say so...<NL>Let's have a listen, then.
Oh! You mean—
Flipping heck, mun! Look lively, will you?<NL>How many animals have you spoken to now? And you still don't know what to do!? Cast that spell, en't it!?
I DID know! I was just going to say that!
(snivel)
Well? Did you discover what has made a mouse of my once mighty dragon?
Well... We've got an idea, yeah.
Grahaha!<NL>Then I suggest you find the cure, fairy!
I shall look forward to seeing it.<NL>Oh, and so you don't get yourselves killed in the meantime, have this.
Gee... Is this one of those treats that make familiars meeta...meta...phor...uh...change?
That it is, boy. I couldn't help but notice you using familiars when you were fighting...
And what a scurvy bunch of scrags they were!<NL>'Tis little wonder old red almost cooked you!
Now, if but one of your familiars had eaten that drop I just gave you and reached the <color:#1>final stage of its development</color>, you'd have beaten her easily!
Hang on, mun! I thought we did beat her easily!<NL>I mean, I hardly broke a sw—
M-Mr. Drippy!<NL>Thank you, Captain Kublai!
I haven't finished, boy! Every creature turns into one of <color:#1>two different types</color> at the final stage of its development. It's up to you to choose the one you want!
Got all that? Good! If you've any sense, you'll use as many of these drops as you can find. And if you can't find any, make your own!
Gee, another formula! Thanks!
Right then, Ollie-boy—drops and familiars are all very interesting, but sorting old Tengri out's ouer top priority, en't it!?
Yeah, you're right. We need to head over to <color:#1>Motorville</color> and find Tengri's soul mate!
Ollie-boy, mun! Look at youer Locket, will you? It's glowing like nobody's business! I'm sure it wasn't doing that before.
So it's...Kublai!? Well, I guess he does have a lot of <color:#1>confidence</color>...
Did you speak my name, boy? Why, then, I take it you've got a cure for my dragon!
Uh... Not just yet, Sir. Sorry...
Grahahahaha! Sorry, are you? Well don't be! At least you're trying—which is more than I can say for the rest of my scurvy crew!
Uh... Actually, Captain Kublai, Sir...we were wondering if we could ask you for a favor...
Out with it, then, boy!<NL>I don't much care for meekness!
Well, there's somebody who's had a piece of their heart stolen, and we were wondering if we could use a piece of your heart to help them...
That's right! After all, not many people have got as much <color:#1>confidence</color> as you, mun!
I don't care much for flattery either, fairy!<NL>...What would you have me do?
You don't need to do anything! Just stand there while Ollie-boy waves his wand, and it'll be over before you know it!
Very well. Do your worst!
Wasn't there something you wanted from me, boy?
That's right, mun! We were after a bit of youer <color:#1>confidence</color>, en't it? Go on, Ollie-boy, get casting!
Grah...<NL>What have you done to me, boy!?
What is this feeling!?<NL>It is... It is...not bad.
Jeepers! That sure is a big hunk of <color:#1>confidence</color>!
Youer not wrong, Ollie-boy!<NL>That Locket of youers is fit to burst!
Now, let's head over to Motorville and mend that Denny lad's broken heart, shall we?
Sure thing, Mr. Drippy!<NL>Thanks a lot, Captain Kublai, Sir!
It was nothing, boy!<NL>You could have taken more for all I cared!
Oh! Before you part—take these.<NL>I found them in a pile of plunder.
They mean nothing to me, but I daresay they might sit well in that magic book of yours.
Hey, they're pages from the Wizard's Companion with new spells for me to try! Thanks, Captain Kublai!
Ta, Pirateface! Right, time to get moving, Ollie-boy! <color:#1>Motorville</color>, here we come!
Hi there, Captain Kublai!<NL>Uh... Do you know where Tengri is?
Graharrr! You come at a good time, boy.<NL>You see...
Grahahahaha!<NL>Tell me, boy, did you find those magic stones?
Well, uh... Not exactly. We did find a big old monument, though. It was—
The point is, Mr. King of the Pirates, is that there were no stones there. Not a single one! I reckon you'd better give us another look at that map of youers!
Hm!? Curious.<NL>And you searched thoroughly?
Thoroughly!? We're trying to save the world, mun! 'Course we searched flipping thoroughly!
Kyah!<NL>Kyaaah! Kyaaah!
Come on, Oliver!<NL>Let's ride on Tenny, all the way to Nazcaä!
It's not foggy there anymore!<NL>Come on, we've got to go!
But... Do you know where Nazcaä is, Pea?
Yes I do!<NL>It's the place with the big birdie picture!
"Big birdie picture"?<NL>You mean, like...a big picture...of a birdie?
Yes, silly! A big birdie, like Doodle-Doo!<NL>Get Tenny to put us down on the big birdie, Oliver!
Doodle-do... That's that Gallus bloke, en't it?<NL>How come she knows so much about him...?
Well, we can worry about that later.<NL>We need to start looking for Nazcaä, Ollie-boy—and that means looking for pictures of birdies!
Okay!<NL>Let's take a ride on Tengri and see if we can find the place Pea's talking about!
A few flaps of these wings and I'll take you wherever you please!
Listen, boy—we have all hands on deck here...
Meaning things are under control. So save your energies.
Your job is to defeat the White Witch.<NL>Let my crew take care of everything else!
Now, get some rest.<NL>We strike at dawn!
...You don't mind sleeping on the deck, do you?<NL>Grahahahaha!
Rest while you have the chance, boy!
What's the matter, boy? Excitement keeping you awake? Grahaha! I know how you feel!
Well?<NL>Are you going to rest or not?
Good morning, Oliver.
I wanted you to know that the Empire is devoting its most advanced weaponry to the assault on the White Witch's palace.
Indeed, this battle will see the first deployment of the "Skysquealer," a new class of light fighter aircraft.
They have been tasked with disabling the Ivory Tower's defenses, thus allowing you to enter.
Oliver, we are counting on you. You must ensure that this terrible ash—this "manna"—is never allowed to fall again!
We won't let you down, Marcassin!
I have instructed my forces to commence the assault on your signal.
Let me know when you are ready.
Understood!
Have you completed your preparations, Oliver?
Very well. Let the assault on the Ivory Tower commence!
Understood.<NL>We await your signal.
I doubt there is much you can do for Tengri, boy.<NL>We have already tried every herb and potion known to man...
A creature can metamorphose into two very different beasts at the last stage of its development. Choose carefully, boy!
Well, boy? Were you able to help someone with that stuff you took from my heart?
The magic stones are hidden on that island!<NL>Tengri's broad wings will take you there in a trice!
Three locations are marked on the map: one to the east of Castaway Cove, one on the Winter Isles, and another off the north coast of Autumnia!
Hmm. Well, I reckon we do the easiest one first.<NL>How about that one near Castaway Cove? We can use that spell to travel there in no time, en't it?
Then we'll hop on the old Sea Cow and look for the one that's north of Autumnia. Then it's just the stone on the Winter Isles... Leave the cold one till last, I say!
The order in which you come by the stones is your concern... But taking the path of least resistance is no way to toughen up!
Good work, boy!<NL>You found those stones soon enough, eh?<NL>Now, I'd better be off. Otherwise she'll—<NL>
Grahaha! You can stop listening now, boy!
Xanadu might be gone, boy, but it won't be forgotten. Not while Khulan and this old pirate draw breath!
We won't rest until the world is safe from Shadar's evil. The way I see it, it's our duty.
Grahaha! You look different, boy...
Perhaps you've finally become a man!<NL>Not a real man like me, of course, but a man all the same. Grahahahaha!
Even the pretty Prince of Hamelin has toughened up, by the looks of it. Didn't think he had it in him!
Maybe he'll live up to his forefathers after all!<NL>Ha! He's lucky he doesn't have to live up to mine!
I'm not easily shocked, boy, but when I saw my crew had been turned into monsters... By the skies...
I had resolved to run them through when your little friend arrived... Lucky she did, eh!? That magic of hers spared a lot of bloodshed!
And it could spare a lot more down there—in the three kingdoms and beyond!
Did you sleep well, boy?<NL>Well, everyone's ready.
It's all down to you now.<NL>Show the White Witch no mercy!
So there's a queen in there, is there?<NL>In that floating palace?
A queen in a palace in the sky...<NL>Reminds me of Xanadu...
But no queen of Xanadu would be capable of such atrocities... The White Witch must be punished. Do what's right, boy!
Kyaaah...
I want to fly, Oliver...
Kyaaah... Kyaaah...
I'm worried about the people down below, Oliver...
Kyaaah! Kyaaaaaah!
Don't worry, Oliver—you'll be safe on my back! I'll fly high in the sky, where the ash can't reach us! Now, let's go and save the three kingdoms.
Kyah! Kyaaah!
Pea said she wanted to talk to you, Oliver!
Kyaaaaaah! Kyaaah!
We're going to Nazcaä? Great!<NL>Just let me know when you're ready to fly!
I'll fight alongside you, Oliver!
Kyah! KYAAAH!
I'm taking you all to the Ivory Tower, right?<NL>Just let me know when you're ready!
Kyah! Kyaaaaaah!
Climb onto my back whenever you want to fly, Oliver!
There's a big birdie picture in Nazcaä, Oliver!<NL>That's where we need to land, okay?
I thought everything was going to be peaceful after we defeated Shadar... I... I keep thinking about the celebration...
Everyone was smiling and waving at us, then that ash started falling...
We've got to look after Pea, Oliver.
If we lost her, we'd lose that spell, and there would be no way to save the victims of the ash.
Is it really true, Oliver?<NL>Is Pea a queen?
But I've been talking to her as though she were an ordinary child!
There's one more town to save, Oliver!
I mean, I want to know more about Pea...<NL>But we've got to help those people first!
My father sometimes mentioned a "forbidden place, shrouded in darkness"...
I always thought he was talking about Nevermore...<NL>But maybe he was talking about Nazcaä?
So the three kingdoms are joining forces to fight against the White Witch...
And I thought that playing the Clarion was supposed to bring peace to the world...
But if we have to fight, that's what we'll do!<NL>And with my father fighting alongside us, we have nothing to fear!
It's time for the final battle, Oliver!
Let's jump on Tengri's back and head for the Ivory Tower!
The battle's not over yet, Oliver!<NL>Cassiopeia's inside the Ivory Tower!
We have to end this!
Did you see that, Oliver?<NL>King Tom turned into a monster right in front of us!
I thought Nightmares were bad, but that was something else...
This mysterious girl that only you can see...<NL>She does exist, right, Oliver?
Sorry. I don't mean to doubt you. It's just...ever since I joined your gang, things have been getting stranger and stranger...and then even stranger.
I thought we were done for when those monsters cornered us on the deck... But then they were back to normal, quick as a flash!
Pea's... She's amazing. No, she's more than amazing—she's save-the-world amazing!<NL>
I want to know Pea's story as well, but we've got more important things to worry about at the moment.
We've got one more town to save from the ash.<NL>That's got to be our priority.
She was trying to save the world by destroying it.<NL>Gah, it'd be funny if it wasn't so...real.
I don't care if the White Witch is Pea.<NL>We've got to stop her. We've got to save the world!
An evil witch covering the world in ash...<NL>It all sounds so ridiculous...<NL>
But then I laughed when you said you were going to beat Shadar as well, Oliver...
It looks like we're going to end up saving the world twice, eh? Well, I suppose it'll get easier with practice. I bet we'll barely notice the third time...
Did Marcassin tell you about the new aircraft from Hamelin? The Skysquealers?
I had no idea they were working on things like that...<NL>And I made it my business to know everything that went on in that town!
Don't worry, Oliver.<NL>I'll be fighting beside you to the end.<NL>There's no running away from this battle.
It's time for you to live up to your name, Savior!
By the time I arrived in Ding Dong Dell, it was already too late. For that, I can only apologize...
Still, now is not the time to dwell on the past.<NL>We must find a way to save this world!
Sanctify... A spell that clears away the ash...<NL>I have never seen such a thing before.
The child, Pea, clearly has special powers that go beyond even those of a Great Sage such as myself...
That woman... The one who called herself "queen"...<NL>She was...Pea. I am certain of it.
But how could she have shown herself to us like that?<NL>I simply cannot fathom it...
The girl who resembled Pea was the young Queen Cassiopeia, was she not?
Surely they cannot be the same person...?<NL>And yet, they must somehow be connected...<NL>
The ash has been cleansed from the three kingdoms, but our work is far from done.
We must learn more about the spell Cassiopeia cast.<NL>The one that caused the ash to fall...
And to do that, we must speak to her directly.<NL>Only then will everything become clear.
Oliver... Unless we stop her, I fear that it is only a matter of time before the White Witch causes that ash to fall upon the world once more.
It is impossible to know the extent of her powers.<NL>Our victory is by no means assured...
But having come this far, there is nothing else for it.<NL>We must fight!
The Ivory Tower is seemingly protected by a barrier—one similar to the Black Briar that surrounded Shadar. It cannot be destroyed.
Our only option, therefore, is to enter the structure and engage the White Witch directly.
We're going to save the world together, Oliver!
I have to show you the flowers, Oliver...
Hee hee! Be careful, Oliver—flowers are very delicate.
What's the matter, Oliver?
You know, Pea... I don't want to fight Queen Cassiopeia...
But it looks like it's the only way to end this...<NL>(sigh) If I can even beat her...
Oh, you can! You can do it, Oliver!
Doodle-Doo made you stronger, didn't he?
You mean Gallus? He...made me stronger?
Yes! Now, go and help Cassiopeia!
Doodle-Doo wanted to test you.
Cassiopeia is in the palace. But she's very unhappy, Oliver...
Please help her!
Don't worry, Pea—I will.<NL>I'll do whatever it takes.
It's almost time, Oliver.<NL>You're going to meet Cassiopeia soon...
Very soon...
What do they call this thing? The "Iron Wyvern," was it? One has never seen such an impressive collection of cannons before!
And the lot of them will be under one's command during the coming assault! Let's give that White Witch what for!
What in the world is protecting that infernal tower!? One has veritably pounded it with one's cannons, and yet it looks quite as pristine as it did before!
One supposes there is nothing for it but to take on the White Witch directly, inside her palace. One shall be leaving that to you, of course.
You are...unhurt!?<NL>But, of course you are. I should expect no less from a wizard that has overcome the Trials.
The world remains in a terrible state, however.<NL>That cursed ash fell also upon my beloved Al Mamoon...
I was fortunate to have been on my way to the celebration in Ding Dong Dell at the time. I dread to think what would have become of me otherwise.
I did not think the world could be saved by one so young... Her heart must be exceptionally pure.
Yes, Oliver...you are not alone in your pure-heartedness.
The three kingdoms fighting as one...<NL>I did not think I would ever see the day.
It was for days such as these that the Clarion was first conceived—when all must stand as one.
A final battle, one that will decide the fate of the world... It pains me that one as young as you must bear such a burden...
But you are strong, Oliver.<NL>You have the heart of a sage.<NL>You can save this world. I know you can.
The ash that fell upon the three kingdoms was the result of an incomparably powerful spell...
And yet it cannot have been Shadar's doing...<NL>Another force is at work here.
You are from another world, and you are blessed with a certain...purity. It gives you untold power—still more than a Great Sage, in fact.
And yet even you are not capable of casting the spell that girl cast. That power is hers alone.
It is strange...
I sense nothing within the Ivory Tower.<NL>No signs of life... Nothing.
The White Witch...<NL>Does she truly wish to destroy this world?
"All the world will surely die<NL>When evil raineth from the sky."
So the ancient prophecy goes.<NL>Perhaps it was referring to this ash?
But why...?<NL>Why would the White Witch do such a thing?
Loneliness, despair, anger...
As soon as you entered the Ivory Tower, I sensed them all. They flooded out from within...
The White Witch's heart must have been full of those emotions. She must have been overwhelmed by them.
Good morning. It would seem the time has finally come.
Al Mamoon's Cloud Sweeper squadron is at your service. Our pilots' talents are world-renowned. They shall not disappoint you.
It would appear that neither cannon fire nor magical attacks can damage the Ivory Tower...
I thought the Cowlipha's Palace in Al Mamoon a sturdy structure, but this is something else entirely...
Drippy-boy, mun! How do?
Eh? What are you two doing by here!?
En't it obvious, mun? We're preparing for the assault on Shadar's stronghold, en't it!?
Eh!?
Yeah, mun! We've brought loads of weapons and that. Shadar doesn't stand a chance!
EH!?
I'll tell you what, though, Drippy-boy—it wasn't easy finding his castle. Took flipping ages, it did—but here we are on the doorstep of destiny at last!
You— You mean you've spent all this time looking for THE DARK DJINN'S castle? And you think that great big WHITE fortress over by there is it!?
That's right, mun! We're just doing what Mam asked us to, en't it!?
...Right. Well, I don't know how to break this to you, boys...
I really don't...
But that en't Shadar's castle.
Huh!?
EHHHHHH!?
HUUUHHH!?
Hang about, there's more... It's Shadar, you see... Well, to cut a long story short, he's already been dealt with, like.
What!?
No!
WHAAAAAAT!?
NOOOOOO!
You've got to be joking, mun...<NL>We spent ouer life savings on these weapons!
Every last guilder! What a flipping waste!
H-Hey, maybe it wasn't a waste! Shadar's gone, but we still have a big battle ahead of us! Actually, we're kinda in the middle of trying to save the world.
I'm sure we'll be able to use the weapons you<NL>brought along!
Y-You mean...?
Ahhh, I see what youer getting at!<NL>There's a clever lad!
Yeah, that's a proper good idea, that is! And it's always been youer dream, en't it, Smiley? You know, providing heroes with the tools of their trade and that...
En't it, though!
'Course, we're just starting out in the weapon business, like, so don't go expecting any discounts or nothing...
YOU WHAT!? You want us to PAY you!? Are you having a flipping laugh!? Oooh, I've half a mind to stick the pair of you in a cannon and fire you back home! Pay you, indeed...
With the Iron Wyvern and a fair wind, there's no corner of the world that's out of our reach!
Do not concern yourself with the workings of the Wyvern, boy. Leave things like that to us sky pirates!
Tengri's a gentle beast, but when those wings start flapping, he fair outstrips even the old Wyvern!
Mark my words, boy: the name Kublai Khan commands respect wherever it is heard!
This vessel is truly impressive...<NL>To look at it, you'd think it had been made in one of the Empire's factories!
Never thought I'd see the day when the three kingdoms fought alongside one another... Truth be told, it still hasn't sunk in.
The soldiers of Ding Dong Dell will not disgrace their kingdom in battle!
Please leave the preparations to us.<NL>It's important for you to get some rest.
I think King Tom might benefit from a rest too. He seems a bit overexcited. Still, it's heartening to see him being so enthusiastic.
Mwahahaha! Greetings!<NL>I'm here to tell you that the <color:#1>C-C-Crypt C-C-Casino</color> is now open for business!
Why don't you c-c-come and pay us a visit?
We've got a fabulous lineup of exciting games, and absolutely spec-c-ctac-c-cular prizes!

Welcome to the RIP Room, where a range of movies have been prepared exclusively for the viewing pleasure of our most esteemed guests.

Now, please take a seat, and enjoy the show!
Sorry, pal. It's RIPs only through here.<NL>That means Real Important People—and not you.<NL>C-C-Capiche?
Looks like you've got yourself an RIP pass.<NL>In you c-c-c-come, then...
Welc-c-come to the C-C-Crypt C-C-Casino!<NL>We're sure you'll have the time of your death!

Mwahahaha! You remember me!?<NL>What an honor!

Mwahahahaha! Thank-k-k-k you!<NL>It certainly is the greatest achievement of my death so far... I hope you enjoy all it has to offer!
But first, a few pointers...

Some of them are so rare, in fac-c-ct, they c-c-cannot be ac-c-c-cquired anywhere else! Mwahahaha!
All right, I think that's everything!<NL>Now, go ahead, have fun! Die a little!
Having fun, I hope? Mwahahaha!
Some of our top-level prizes really are to live for, you know. Good luck-ck-ck!
Ah! There you are, Mr. Oliver! Mwahahaha!<NL>I've been look-k-k-king all over for you!
F-For me...?
That's right!<NL>There's something I've been wanting to give you—your very own RIP pass!
An RIP pass...?
You know how much your patronage is valued here at the C-C-Crypt C-C-Casino, Mr. Oliver...
This RIP pass is just our way of saying thank-k-k-ks! Mwahaha!
It'll grant you access to the myriad delights of the RIP Room! Please, tak-k-k-ke it!
An RIP pass...for me?<NL>I'm not sure I should be accepting this...
What are you on about, mun!?<NL>'Course you flipping should!
It's not every day someone invites you into their RIP Room, you know!
Yeah, I guess...<NL>Well, thank you very much, Mr. Skeleton!
The door to the RIP Room is on your right.
Please, go ahead and see what it has to offer! I'm qu-qu-quite sure you'll find the experience...memorable!
The door to the RIP Room is on your right.<NL>Go ahead, see what it has to offer!
What's more, I'm going to give you this RIP pass!
It'll let you experience the myriad delights of the RIP Room, which you'll find on your right.
This is a once in a deathtime opportunity, so be so sure to go and tak-k-k-ke a look-k-k-k!
C-C-Correct me if I'm wrong, but you and your friends have never been wiped out in ac-c-ctual battle, have you?
Well, you should c-c-c-count your blessings!<NL>Such a defeat is a fate worse than life! Bwahahaha!
Oh dear! You have the look-k-k of one who has experienced the pain of being wiped out in battle...
Well, do not c-c-c-concern yourself with it unduly. Such fretting will be the life of you! Bwahaha!
In fac-c-c-ct, you should feel free to be defeated as many times as you wish. Don't worry—I'll be k-k-k-keeping c-c-c-count!
Uh... Thanks, I guess...
No need to thank-k-k-k me, dear boy! It is my pleasure! Now, the number of wipeouts you have suffered so far is...
Mwaha! So good to see you again! Now, the number of times you have been wiped out in battle so far is...
A mere <color:#1><global_short:count_retry_num></color>!
Very impressive! Perhaps you don't fit in with us livebeats after all, eh? Bwahahaha!
<color:#1><global_short:count_retry_num></color>!
Crik-k-k-key!<NL>You're really rack-ck-ck-cking up those defeats! It's just a shame one can't mak-k-k-ke a dying from losing!
Oh my! <color:#1><global_short:count_retry_num></color> times!
Maybe you should c-c-consider playing Platoon instead of fighting...? Only jok-k-king! When one is tired of fighting, one is tired of death!
You wish to try your luck on the slots, do you?<NL>Then I must advise you to choose your machine with utmost c-c-c-care.
Some machines drop chips as though there were no tomorrow, while others refuse to give even a sniff of a prize! Moohaha!
C-c-c-crikey! Is that a platinum tick-ck-ck-et you've got there? That means you can watch the greatest c-c-c-comedy scene of them all!
When I first saw it, I c-c-c-cracked up so hard, my jawbone fell c-c-c-clean off!
My darling wife and I formed our eternal bond while playing Double C-C-C-Cross!
The sense of achievement when we reach the goal at the same time... Why, it's the glue that k-k-k-keeps us together!
Winning big on the slots is all about using one's items at the right time!
Kyahahahaha! BWAHAHAHA!<NL>How about that, eh!?<NL>Two Black-ck-ckjack-ck-cks in a row!
...
Who'd have thought that the dead have such fabulous facilities? Perhaps dying isn't the end of the world after all!
Hoping to win big, are you? Hee hee! I'm just here to pass the time, personally—I do have plenty of it, after all!
Arrr! Another fine haul!<NL>'Tis much easier than pillaging, that's for sure!
Garrr! To the depths with this accursed game! I've lost again! Why could we not stick to honest pillaging...?

Welcome to the Cat's Cradle chain of purremium inns! At this branch we purride ourselves on purrotecting travelers from the elements!
It may be cold outside, but there'll always be a warm welcome here at the Cat's Cradle!
Ah! I am thinking that you are the travelers, yes?
The ones who are wanting to head into the <color:#1>Glittering Grotto</color>? Purrofessor Tabitha told me you would<NL>be coming...
That's us, Sir!<NL>So...would it be all right if we went inside?
It would be being all right...but the terrain to the north of here is being bitterly cold and very, very snowy...
Don't worry about that, mun!<NL>Kids like Ollie-boy love a bit of snow, en't it!?
Hmm. It seems you are determined to go no matter what I am saying... Am I thinking correctly?
Uh... I guess you are, Sir!
Oh ho ho! Then I will be opening the gate for you now. You should be heading out before the temperature is dropping further.
Thank you, Mr. Elder, Sir!
Oh! I was nearly forgetting!<NL>Yes, you would surely be dying without them...
Huh...!?
Please to wait a moment!<NL>I am bringing them to you right away!
I wish I could purrovide you with a place to stay, but I don't have much space to spare with Åke around...
Oh, don't worry, Ma'am!<NL>We'll go to the Cat's Cradle like we always do!
Good morning, Oliver! Now, you should have no purroblem finding the Elder's residence—it's the big house on top of the frozen pond!
Oh, my! You look as handsome as a purrince, Oliver! Just wait until the Daily Yarn gets to hear about this!
Oh, Oliver! You made it back in one piece! Thank goodness! I was purraying for your safe return, you know!
Oliver! How purrfectly wonderful to see you again! I take it your adventure is as exciting as ever? Purrhaps one day you can tell me all about it!
When my teacher is getting excited, she is beginning to talking like a cat! But, do not be telling anyone! This is being our secret, yes?
My teacher, she is being very angry with me today... Yesterday I was staying up late eating ice stew, yes...
When my teacher is getting very excited, she is sometimes making a "meow" sound! I hope this is not happening to meow! Oh...
Purrofessor Tabitha is writing her next paper, yes... It is being an analysis of your adventures, Oliver!
Oh no! My teacher's new paper is being called "Incompetent Students: When to Admit They Are Beyond Help"!
She is meaning me, yes...?
Oh ho ho! Those winter clothes are really suiting you! Still, it is being extremely cold in the <color:#1>Glittering Grotto</color>. You will be taking care, won't you?
Oh! You have come back!<NL>I am being most relieved!
Welcome to the Winter Isles! We are being blessed with both beauty and bitter cold! Please be taking it easy here!
A terrifying monster is hiding in the Glittering Grotto—that is what the rumors are saying... I am not going anywhere near that place, oh no!
The entrance to the Glittering Grotto is being this way, but there are lots of monsters, and it is being dangerous for the children.
Look at how beautiful our town is being!<NL>With views like these it is easy to be forgetting how cold it is, yes?
The people of Yule are being good at dealing with the cold, but very bad at dealing with heat. I think the local monsters are probably being exactly the same...
Ha ha! I am building the biggest snowman in Yule!
I am loving walking on the snow!<NL>It is feeling like a crunchy soft carpet!
Hmm... But mine is being much cuter!<NL>Much, much cuter!
Awwwwww!<NL>Every time I am touching, so fluffy fluffy!
Living in a snowy place is not being so bad.<NL>I am eating as much ice stew as I am wanting, and never am I getting fat...
But my washing is always freezing stiff when I am hanging it out for drying.
My back is hurting a lot of late...<NL>I have been straining, talking to big tall tomte...
Yule is being very famous for its ice stew—best for eating with many friends!
The coldness of the ice is cooling you down, and the warmth of friendship is warming you up! Ha ha!<NL>
My grandchildren are playing in the snow with the tomte...
I am being very relieved that everyone is getting along so well, oh yes...
Welcome to Yule, town of ice and snow!<NL>The air outside may be being cold, but our hearts are always being very, very warm!
If you are having a problem, please be talking to me, yes? We are being friends now!
I am making cold compress for you, yes?<NL>It will be making you feel much much better!
The sky is being very clear tonight, yes?<NL>We are seeing the aurora without difficulty!
My brother, he is always telling me he is exploring the northern caves. Yesterday, he was telling me about secret passages that are hiding in there...
Stop saying those things!<NL>I am blushing, yes...?
If my fur was looking like the aurora, I would be being even cuter, yes?
Right now it is being perfect fishing season!<NL>The fish are growing plump and juicy. Yum!
I-It's a b-b-bit c-c-cold h-h-here, isn't it?<NL>B-B-But everyone is very k-k-kind...
It's f-f-f-f-f-freezing!<NL>B-B-But the v-v-view makes it all worthwhile!
It is approaching the time for checking the snow houses! I must be asking the local children to be helping us...
The tomte are always helping us with the carving of the ice for the houses. We are feeling very lucky to have them!
If you are using a hole like this one, anyone can be catching fish here! It is a big part of Yule's charm, I am thinking!
When fishing, you must be focusing all your energies into your fingertips! That way, you will be catching big plump fish!
Outsiders are always freezing to death here, yes? They are not wearing proper clothing...
Oh! But I am seeing that you are not being like that! You are having no problems, I am thinking!
I am entering in the Solosseum Series at the Temple of Trials! I am feeling super super excited!
But... I am hearing the Temple of Trials is being in the middle of the desert. I am worrying I will be melting there...
Ah! You are having been the one I was fighting in the Solosseum Series, yes!?
You are being a very good fighter!<NL>I was learning a lot about the ways of the world that day, yes...

If it's <color:#1>love</color> you're after, look no further—no man cares more for a woman than I for Khulan!
We need a ladleful of <color:#1>love</color> from old Pirateface! He's got flipping hearts in his eyes, the big softie!
Thanks, Captain Kublai! Gee... That sure is a lot of <color:#1>love</color>! That should be more than enough!
Now we just need to give old Khulan a lend of it!
I'm counting on you, boy! Use your magic to give her my love, and bring her back to me!
Curse you, Kublai! I have no need of love from a baseborn ruffian such as you.
You know the drill, Ollie-boy! Shovel that <color:#1>love</color> her way, and she'll be right as rain!
B-But... H-How...!?<NL>My... My heart...
Why did you have to interfere!? ...Y-You've ruined everything! Begone! Torment me no more!
Grahaharrr! What are you waiting for, boy!?<NL>Do you mean to send Khulan my <color:#1>love</color> or not!?
Take a look around this town, and see how it has been blessed by the Queen of the Heavens...
Shadar... The Dark Djinn... The beast who laid waste to Xanadu.
Now I know why Queen Khulan has acted as she has... Gah! How could I fail to see Shadar's hand in this, I who scarce left her side?
Yaya!
It is Queen Khulan!<NL>Her heart is broken, too!<NL>We must help her, yaya!
But cariño! C-Can it be?<NL>Can the Dark Djinn have been controlling her all along?
The blessings of the Queen cleanse our hearts.<NL>We have no more worries, or fears.
Once all of us are blessed, we can live together in perfect happiness.
We need not think. We need not do anything.<NL>If this is not freedom, tell me what is.
Ah, surely this is what it means to be truly free...
They say all will be washed away...<NL>All will be made clean.
They say I will never have to worry again...
¡Hola! Look at her! She is very cute, is she not? She is the cutest llapaca of all!
When she grows up, maybe she too will receive the blessings of Queen Khulan!
Why does she bleat? What is wrong?
That llapaca, it is old enough to look after itself. You give it too much attention!
Th-This llapaca... See how it trembles! I did nothing to it, I swear!
You! Outsiders! What are you doing here?<NL>You must not disturb the peace of Perdida!
Sister, what is the matter?
When you are blessed by Queen Khulan, your eyes become as clear as the blue sky.
Look into my eyes! You will see no fear or pain!
To be free of fear... To be free of pain...<NL>This is true happiness, I am sure...
We are like the flowers. We are blessed to simply be here, to simply be alive...
Did you hear? Someone was shouting. Could it be Nina? But she should have received the blessing by now...
Queen Khulan is preparing for the ceremony. You may go no further.
Only when we receive the blessing of Queen Khulan can we be truly happy.
What is happening? I do not understand... Was Queen Khulan's blessing not meant to bring us peace and happiness?
We who have been blessed feel no more fear.
We who lived for so long in terror of the Dark Djinn are now free from all fear.
I heard a terrible voice... But how can this be?<NL>I thought we had been rescued from all fear.
Young Nina has not yet been blessed.
Maybe that is why there is so much fear in her eyes.
We are the blessed ones, are we not?
I have heard that the giant man has come to our town once again. What has brought one so fearsome to Perdida?
Did you see her? Did you see Queen Khulan?

May we begin the ceremony, Oliver?
Uh... Sure! Ready when you are, Your Highness!
Um... Would you mind waiting a little while longer, Your Highness?
Please let me know as soon as you are ready to begin.
I cannot easily make amends for what I have done.
But I must strive to do all I can to bring hope to this place. And this time without any dubious "blessings"...
So the Clarion is complete... Then it is only a matter of time before the veil of miasma is parted.
So Oliver remains unconscious... I am afraid I do not know how to help him.
But we must have faith, and pray that he recovers. What else can we do?
With Mornstar restored, your powers are greater than ever. Indeed, certain chests will now open at your command. Why, there is one in this very town.
How can we ever thank you enough?<NL>You have freed Queen Khulan from Shadar's bonds.
What Shadar wrought upon Xanadu cannot be undone, but now I feel my brothers and sisters can rest a little easier.
I vow to stand beside my queen and protect this town.
So that poor boy has still not awoken...<NL>Queen Khulan is most concerned about him.
Thank you, Oliver!<NL>The hearts of all the people are whole again!
When I hear Queen Khulan's voice, I know everything will be all right.
What is the matter with Oliver?<NL>I pray he awakes soon.
We cannot leave everything to Queen Khulan. We must stand up to Shadar. If we don't, how can we say this town has truly changed?
We must have hope in our hearts.<NL>That is the way to defy Shadar.
Peace has returned to our town.<NL>For this blessing, we are grateful to Queen Khulan.
This young man has sunk deep into the depths of sadness and despair... We can but wait and hope he emerges from them unscathed.
Come on, Ollie-boy... Don't leave us like this, mun!
I met Queen Khulan when she ruled over Xanadu, a kingdom built on a floating island in the sky.
By chance, my crew and I were away on a voyage when Shadar struck. When we returned, no trace of Xanadu remained.
To think I would find my queen again, here in the back of beyond... Grahaharr! it's enough to make my hard heart believe in miracles.
Ah, it is truly gladdening to see the people of Perdida restored to their old selves.
These people harbored us when we fled from the ruins of Xanadu, with my queen gravely injured, and her heart broken.
And how did we repay them? With "blessings" that were neither good nor true.
But it's not your fault, Sir.<NL>You were just obeying Queen Khulan.
Obedience is no excuse.<NL>I could— I should have done something.
There's no point crying over spilt milk, mun!<NL>This town's back to normal, so all's well that ends well, en't it?
You are right, of course. And now I will do all I can to protect the people of this town.
That's great, Sir!
You have my gratitude. Thank you all for saving my queen.
What Shadar wrought on Xanadu cannot be undone, but I sense that those who lost their lives are grateful to you. I feel sure the ghostly guard you met would agree...
Few artifacts from Xanadu now remain, but I have held on to this. Here. Take it. It is yours.
It is hard to believe that the dark shadow of Shadar lay behind the Queen's blessings.
You may think Perdida is poor, but gaze at the mountains. See how the sun sets behind them. Are we not truly blessed with riches?
Not even a quiet, peaceful town such as ours was spared the darkness Shadar has cast across our land.
Now I fear that the boy faces the same darkness.<NL>I pray he will escape it soon.
What kind of future awaited us if we had blindly clung to those "blessings"?
(yawn) Nothing ever happens here!
I want just once in my life to visit Hamelin. There must be something happening there all of the time.
That boy... Is he all right?
We believed the blessings would cleanse us... That they would make us forget everything.
But what kind of life is that? There are some things that should never be forgotten, no matter how sad, no matter how painful.
You may be surprised to learn that this clear, pure water flows from the Miasma Marshes.
Oh, please tell me...<NL>What lies beyond the Miasma Marshes?
This baby llapaca did not stop bleating. Could it have been her way of trying to wake me, and make me see the truth?
This llapaca was only born last month. Now I take care of her, and we are always together!
See how fluffy she is!
Why does my baby llapaca bleat like this?<NL>Is she trying to tell me something, perhaps?
This is terrible!<NL>The supplies of llapaca food have run dry!
I have no time to speak!<NL>I must finish my work before the sun sets.
Hm. Perhaps it is time to rest for today.
Ah, I am feeling dizzy.<NL>Perhaps it is time to stop work for today.
Nina told me. She said she was afraid of Queen Khulan's blessing. She said she was afraid of all those who had been blessed.
Finally, I understand her words.
Hermana, you must not carry around the baby llapaca all of the time. How will it learn to stand on its own two feet?
How is he now? Is he still asleep?<NL>If there is anything we can do, please tell us.
Look at these flowers...<NL>They too are trying their best to live their lives.
Why do flowers smell so nice?<NL>Maybe they wish for people to love them.
Maybe I will take flowers to the boy who is asleep. I pray he wakes soon.
Nina was always so sad, but I pretended not to notice. Oh, I feel so sorry!
This is the most beautiful place in our town.<NL>...Huh!? There is nothing here, you say!?
Look up at the sky!<NL>See how the evening sun lights up all beneath it.<NL>Can you see now why we love this place?
When I have doubts or fears, I come here to watch the sun set. That is when I feel truly blessed with peace.
It was some time ago that Queen Khulan arrived here with her guard. She was gravely injured, and we gave them shelter in our humble town.
But when I think back, there was always something cold about the Queen's eyes.
For as long as I can remember, the Miasma Marshes have been a place of death.
Yet the water that flows from there has been a lifeline to us in Perdida. It is so pure and clear. Is it not strange?
Ai-ai-ai... My back! It hurts! It hurts!<NL>Oh, do not worry about me. I am merely old.
Perhaps we brought this all on ourselves.<NL>We were not strong enough to resist.
All children brim with curiosity. My own grandchild asks me questions from morning until night.
But I believe these is wisdom in the questions of children. There is much we can learn from them.
I know you are fearful, but you must always have faith in the future.
So what Queen Khulan gave to us was no blessing.
Yet we did not resist. We merely clung to her. We are to blame, not her...
In Perdida, the pace of life is slow. But it suits me well. I feel truly blessed to live here.
But for our young people, it must be a little too quiet.
What is all this hustle and bustle? What is going on?
So the giant man who came to Queen Khulan's aid is called Kublai? He is a mountain of a man.
Con permiso... Please let me get through!
I must deliver this food before it becomes cold!
Ah, there is no rest for me!

So the Clarion is complete... Then it is only a matter of time before the veil of miasma is parted.
So you have awoken. I am glad. Your heart proved strong enough to withstand the darkness. It is clear to me now that you have the power to change our world.
Seeing Queen Khulan smiling once again, surrounded by the townsfolk... It brings it all back to me.
She represented hope for every man, woman and child in Xanadu. And now she brings hope to the lives of others. Truly, it is a sight to warm the heart.
Wh-Where have you been? You have only just recovered! Surely you should not be wandering about! ...I'm sorry. It's just that I worry...
I vow to stand beside my queen and protect this town.
Have you heard? Queen Khulan once lived in a city in the clouds. But the city is gone now.
Oliver! You are better! I am so happy!
When I hear Queen Khulan's voice, I know everything will be all right.
The people of Perdida have refound their smiles.<NL>But last night, I had a dream...
I dreamt that misfortune would visit our world once again. Should I keep this to myself, or tell the others? Oh, I do not know what to do...
It is you! Are you all right? You have only just awoken, but already you are running around with your wand in your hand.
I am glad you have recovered. But when I look deep in your eyes, I see the sadness and despair you had to conquer in order to come back to us.
Peace has returned to our town.<NL>For this blessing, we are grateful to Queen Khulan.
Ah, it is truly gladdening to see the people of Perdida restored to their old selves.
These people harbored us when we fled from the ruins of Xanadu, with my queen gravely injured, and her heart broken.
And how did we repay them? With "blessings" that were neither good nor true.
But it's not your fault, Sir.<NL>You were just obeying Queen Khulan.
Obedience is no excuse.<NL>I could— I should have done something.
There's no point crying over spilt milk, mun!<NL>This town's back to normal, so all's well that ends well, en't it?
You are right, of course. And now I will do all I can to protect the people of this town.
That's great, Sir!
You have my gratitude. Thank you all for saving my queen.
What Shadar wrought on Xanadu cannot be undone, but I sense that those who lost their lives are grateful to you. I feel sure the ghostly guard you met would agree...
Few artifacts from Xanadu now remain, but I have held on to this. Here. Take it. It is yours.
...!<NL>......
I am glad to meet you once again.<NL>So this is the town of Perdida.
Though my queen has already departed, I have been reunited with my beloved Alph.
He cannot see me, but I can be with him, and watch over him. This is all I ask.
They say the marshes are clear of the evil miasma that gave them their name. Now a beautiful lake stands there. How I long to see it!
You may think Perdida is poor, but gaze at the mountains. See how the sun sets behind them. Are we not truly blessed with riches?
In the old days, travelers from Hamelin would visit us from time to time. I miss them...
Perdida has changed a lot since you first arrived.
Ah, how I wish to travel the world like you.<NL>There is so much to see and do!
(yawn) Nothing ever happens here!
I want just once in my life to visit Hamelin. There must be something happening there all of the time.
That guard... He looks so strong and noble.<NL>See how his armor glitters in the evening sun!
Ah! You are awake! ...But wait! You look different. You look...more grown-up, somehow.
The crystal-clear water you see here flows from the Miasma Marshes...though that name no longer seems fitting.
Here in Perdida, we care for baby llapacas just as we care for our own children.
For us, llapacas are like family. They do not speak, but they understand everything.
She grows bigger every day. Soon she will want to run free. It makes me feel sad...
This llapaca was born not so very long ago. Now I take care of her, and we are always together!
See how fluffy she is!
This llapaca has grown big. We have lived with this family of llapacas since my father was a boy.
What is it? Do you want to stroke the llapaca?
I have no time to speak!<NL>I must finish my work before the sun sets.
I want Queen Khulan to teach me magic!<NL>I want to be a wizard, just like you!
I heard Queen Khulan say you were a great wizard. She said you had a strong heart, and had overcome despair.
Hermana, you must not carry around the baby llapaca all of the time. How will it learn to stand on its own two feet?
Do not be fooled! They may look half-asleep, but llapacas are always alert. They are powerful animals.
You are better! Oh, I am so happy!
Why do flowers smell so nice?<NL>Maybe they wish for people to love them.
In Perdida, it is thought beautiful for girls to have thick, glossy eyebrows.
Tell me! Who is prettier? Me or Nina?
When I watch the sun set in the evening, I forget all my worries. It is so strange...
This is the most beautiful place in our town.<NL>...Huh!? There is nothing here, you say!?
Look up at the sky!<NL>See how the evening sun lights up all beneath it.<NL>Can you see now why we love this place?
They say an ancient castle lies to the north of the Miasma Marshes.
Over a century ago, there was a great war, and the kingdom that once stood there was wiped out.
For as long as I can remember, the Miasma Marshes were a place of death.
Yet the water that flows from there has always been pure and clear. I suppose we shall never know why...
We once believed the miasma over the marshes would never clear.
It has always been there, since I was a child. People used to say that the mists hid a beautiful lake... Perhaps now it can finally be seen.
You have awoken! I am so glad!
All children brim with curiosity. My own grandchild asks me questions from morning until night.
But I believe these is wisdom in the questions of children. There is much we can learn from them.
In my youth, I lived in the city.
It was so exciting, and I never wanted to go back to Perdida. But then one day, I felt my home calling to me, and back I came, just like that.
If ever you want to forget your worries, please come and see us in Perdida. You are always welcome.
In Perdida, the pace of life is slow. But it suits me well. I feel truly blessed to live here.
But for our young people, it must be a little too quiet.
Many potatoes grow around Perdida. We eat them with melted butter made from llapaca milk. There is nothing quite like it!
Con Permiso... Please let me get through!
I must deliver this food before it becomes cold!

Welcome to my world, Ollie-boy!<NL>Well, what do you reckon? Beautiful, en't it?
Now, that town over by there is Ding Dong Dell.<NL>Cracking views over the rolling hills, they've got.
And just a bit further away is the wide open sea!<NL>If you squint, you can see a proper tidy ship by there and all!
Feel free to have a stroll around Ding Dong Dell, or cast off in search of adventure on the high seas! What you do with youer time here's up to you, mun!
This would appear to be a dead end...<NL>But I am quite certain that there was once a bridge here... Curious.
A path has opened along the cliffside!<NL>...And yet I fear I lack the courage to follow it.<NL>Ghouls lie in wait, I am almost certain...
Taking it easy in ouer world, is it? There's beautiful!
How about we pay a quick visit to Ding Dong Dell, Ollie-boy?
There's no need to stay near Ding Dong Dell the whole time, Ollie-boy! There's a whole world out there for you to explore, mun!
Did you see that bird just now, Ollie-boy?<NL>Massive, it was!
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!

This is my secret den!<NL>Pretty amazing, eh?
Heh! You should probably take a look<NL>around Ding Dong Dell, shouldn't you?
This is the royal palace of Ding Dong Dell.<NL>Magnificent, isn't it?
To reach Al Mamoon, purroceed directly through<NL>Golden Grove to the south of here. Mmmyou can't<NL>miss it! Travel safely now, boy!
Oh, how purrfectly awful! I'm afraid all<NL>our rooms are full at the moment.<NL>Please accept our humblest apologies...
I'm afraid there aren't any tasks available<NL>at the moment. You'll just have to swallow<NL>your disappointment and come back later.
Sorry, dearie, I'm afraid there was a<NL>sudden rush, and we've sold out of<NL>everything. Hoo'd have thought it, eh?
Travelers, eh? I'm afraid I can't sell you my<NL>wares without the King's permission. Can't be<NL>too cawtious where weapons are concerned...
Looks like there's nothing doing for<NL>today, mun. Let's come back another<NL>time, eh?
This is Swift Solutions. People post errands<NL>up on the Errand Board. Take a look—you might<NL>be able to purrovide some help to the needy.
And if you complete an errand successfully,<NL>the purrson who requested it is honor-bound<NL>to give you a purresent to say thank-you.
Zzz... Zzz...
Oh, it is, it is, dear!<NL>It makes me happy just to see it!
Everyone has been so happy lately.<NL>It really is marvelous, isn't it, dear?
Ahh, another fine day!<NL>I think I shall spend it lounging in<NL>the sunshine...
If you go down the steps here, you'll come to<NL>the entrance to the waterway that purrovides<NL>the town's drinking water.
It's purretty dangerous down there—<NL>not to mention horribly wet.<NL>Children like you should keep away.
You can buy weapons and armor at<NL>the Cawtermaster's Stores over there.
I wonder if you can equip familiars with<NL>items like that... That would be ever<NL>so useful...
Ooh, you're a wizard, aren't you? I know it's<NL>a hard path you've chosen, but keep your<NL>chin up and do your best now, won't you?
Let me see... First there's the shopping<NL>to finish, then I'd better hurry home<NL>and make a start on that pie...
This town was built by the grimalkin, you know.<NL>They're the cat people you see everywhere.<NL>Why, even our king is a cat!
It's no bad thing, though. We haven't<NL>seen a single mouse around these parts<NL>in ages!
Welcome, young man.<NL>Would you like some delicious fruit?
Do you know why Ding Dong Dell is so<NL>pretty? It's because of all the flowers<NL>and trees everywhere!
And all the sparkly water, too!
Guess what? The King himself came out<NL>to play with us the other day!
And he promised to come and play with<NL>us again! Long live the King! Hee hee!
You new? I forget.<NL>Welcome to Ding Dong Dell, and all that.
If you want to see the King, just take the<NL>road right through the middle of town.
Little girls have to always try and be<NL>purretty! That's the law!
Right! That's the laundry and the cleaning done,<NL>now for the shopping!
Welcome to the beautiful town of<NL>Ding Dong Dell! It may seem sleepy,<NL>but there's plenty to see and do!
Are you here to visit our kingdom? The people of<NL>Ding Dong Dell can't wait to welcome you!
Motherrr! Can we go hooome soooooon?
Now then, what shall we have for dinner<NL>this evening...?
My wife is the best cook in the kingdom!<NL>Her food is fit for the King himself!
I've seen you rushing around town.<NL>You should relax a little, you know.<NL>It can always wait until tomorrow...
I'm sorry, but I can't let you into the palace<NL>just now.
Visitors aren't allowed in while the King is<NL>being groomed. It just wouldn't do.
The palace lies just beyond here.
Normally, visitors are welcome to look<NL>around, but I'm afraid it's off-limits at<NL>the moment.
The Grave of the Sage lies just beyond<NL>here. You are welcome to see it, but we ask<NL>that you maintain a respectful silence.
Mmmyummm... What shall we play today?
Apparently, the king of the mice lives<NL>down in the waterway below town. And<NL>they say he's enormous!
Hm? How big? Why, as big as an ulk,<NL>or so I'm told!
Ahh, Ding Dong Dell is such a lovely place!<NL>It's the perfect combination of town and<NL>countryside. Just perfect...
Not like that Hamelin over in the east.<NL>There's not a scrap of greenery within<NL>miles of that dingy old place...
Did you know the King was all slow and lazy,<NL>but now he's all awake and busy?
He's so lucky! He can do whatever he wants!<NL>I want to be a king, too!
Let's play Mummies and Daddies!
Oh, silly me! I forgot to hang out the laundry!<NL>I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on!
Ahh, another fine day!<NL>And soon I shall be off to work!
The Great Tug-o'-Tail Tournament begins soon...<NL>I had better start purracticing.
Do you know who that fine statue over<NL>there is of? Why, our beloved king, of course!
What's that? He reminds you of someone?<NL>Impossible! There's no one else like<NL>King Tom!
Purrhaps you've seen the pots dotted<NL>around town? You should take a look<NL>inside them, you know.
You'd be surpurrised what you can find.<NL>Be sure to check them all, won't you?
Ahh, how lovely! I've been feeling just<NL>marvelous lately!
Fit as a fiddle, and ready for anything!<NL>I don't know what's come over me! Tee hee!
We've gone to all the trouble of getting<NL>ouerselves a boat. The least we could<NL>do is go for a flipping sail in it, mun!
Ahh, what a lovely breeze. There's soothing...<NL>Fancy a quick nap? I know I do...
Don't get lost now, mun!<NL>I'm rubbish at directions!
Ahh, there's nothing like a good castle<NL>to make you feel like youer on an<NL>adventure, eh? Tidy!
There's no shortage of fishies round by here, eh? D'you reckon they taste all right?<NL>I might give one a try...
Look at those clouds, mun! Like big fluffy loaves of bread, they are! Gah, I've gone and made myself hungry now...
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!

You lot are travelers, I take it?
That's right, Sir!<NL>We're here to look for the Great Sage!<NL>We heard he served the Prince.
...A Great Sage, you say? Hah!<NL>You'll have to look elsewhere, I'm afraid.<NL>The Palace is strictly off-limits.
Off-limits?
His Highness, the Prince, has spoken.<NL>We are under strict orders to...eject any undesirables.
Undesirables!? Flipping cheek!<NL>Don't you know who I am, mun?
Go on... Be a sport! Let us in, eh?<NL>It's a special day, en't it? Parades, cheering crowds, all that business...
Hmmm... I suppose it is a special day, what with the royal procession and so on...
All right! Just this once...<NL>You may enter the palace...
Really? Neato!<NL>Thank you, Sir!
I knew he'd see sense, mun. You just have to know how to talk to these people... Watch this...
...Excuse me, boyo! Would you mind letting me try on youer fancy helmet?
Wh-What!? My helmet...?<NL>Wait! What are you playing at!?
Direct orders from His Highness, the Prince!<NL>The Palace is now strictly off-limits.
No riff-raff or rabble shall pass.<NL>...And yes, I am referring to you.
You're looking for a room, I purresume?<NL>Well, I'm sorry to say we're fully booked.<NL>Purrhaps you could come back another time?
You're an early bird! I'm still setting up shop.<NL>I've got no tasks for you just yet.
I'm sorry. A veritable flock of customers descended on us earlier today, and now I'm owl out of stock.
Caw! I hope you didn't travel far to get here.<NL>The Prince has forbidden anyone from buying weapons without his permission.
This here is the Errand Board. Looks like there's a severe shortage of work today.
Hm. Travelers, are you? You certainly look like you lack a fixed abode. Well, while you are in our kingdom, you will obey our laws.
Back in the old emperor's day, we had our fair share of rules and regulations, but his son's just gone too blinking far...
These huge royal processions can be a little on the dangerous side, don't you think?
A land of endeavor and invention, Hamelin is the envy of the world. And it's all down to good honest work!
As much as I love them, these royal processions can be a little nerve-racking. Last time, I was almost flattened by a fast-moving building...
Grandmama! Did you remember to switch off the light in the living room? Father said it was against the law to leave it on...
Dear me. I went to all the trouble of having a pair of rather fetching bathing trunks imported from Castaway Cove.
But no sooner had they arrived than they were confiscated. Apparently, they contravened the law on minimum trouser length!
Oi, you! You may not be from Hamelin, but if you like machines, I can learn to like you.
Don't be shy about dropping by!
Your armor looks a little past its best, I fear.<NL>Why not trade it in for a newer model?
They say the cogs under the buildings are so big, a hundred men couldn't lift them!
Every man, woman and child in Hamelin knows the difference between a crankshaft and a piston rod. What an enlightened place!
Machines and rain just don't mix.<NL>That's why we've got a great, big roof covering the whole city of Hamelin.
She is my number one student.<NL>One day, her discoveries will change the world, you mark my words.<NL>
No one forgets the first royal procession they see in Hamelin. You'll never look at buildings the same way again!
Oh, I say! I'd almost forgotten what people looked like without a pig mask on.
Well, apart from the Prince's servant, of course.<NL>He never wears one.
We've had to wear armor for quite a while here in Hamelin, and it gets heavier with each passing year. Ah, I'm getting old...
Have you ever heard tell of Perdida?<NL>They say the beautiful plains around it glisten like gold in the sun...
Someone told me that the roof covering our city is not just to keep the rain off...
But they didn't tell me what else it was for.<NL>Your guess is as good as mine.
I've seen a fair few places, but nowhere that was half as developed as Hamelin!
Innovators such as I have no time to concern ourselves with our personal appearance.<NL>It makes one grateful for these pig suits!
Have you tried the local black truffles?<NL>You can't walk ten paces in this city without catching the scent of one... (sniff)
Most of my meager wages are frittered away on those mouthwatering morsels...
I've ordered a swimsuit.<NL>I'm going to wear it under my armor and pretend I'm on holiday in Castaway Cove.
Ah, I noticed you admiring my gloves...<NL>They're so thick, I could juggle red-hot coal all day without batting an eyelid.
The great thing about this helmet is that I can experiment with my facial hair, and no one will ever laugh at me!
Hmmm... If I stare at you long enough, I'm sure you'll do something wrong...
It's not only for processions. Sometimes they shift the streets about just because they can.
They say the location of the Black Market changes every time. Where could it be now,<NL>I wonder?
Don't worry, I made sure I switched all the lights out before I left the house. I know the law!
My grandchildren are growing up so fast, it costs a pretty penny to keep them in pig armor.
The plains around Hamelin are hopping with jackrabbots. They don't mean any harm, so go easy on them.
Hello, young man. I hope you and your friends aren't here to make mischief.
...I'm sure you're not. It's just that I've come across some rum sorts in the past.
In Hamelin, we don't compete with one another. We all work together for the greater good of the Empire.
I have heard it said that there is an area of stunning natural beauty here on our continent of Autumnia.
Who would want to live in the countryside!?<NL>Hamelin is the place to be!
Who knows, I might need to buy them a suit of armor before too long...
You don't get many foreign goods coming into Hamelin these days. You can't find a babana for love nor money.
Argh! Curse these stupid outfits!<NL>They call us Hamelin Hogs behind our backs, you know?
They say there's a backstreet blacksmith who will inlay the inside of your helmet with gold leaf... Now that's style!
Mummy! This pig armor is too big and baggy for me!
The Taskmaster was telling me some tales of your death-defying derring-do.
I can't believe you're the same age as me and you're already on a real adventure!
The guards wear different helmets to normal folks. Their eyes look scary!
The Prince always has his subjects' best interests at heart. He makes them wear that armor to keep them safe.
Article 2546 of the constitution forbids any unauthorized building of rails on the roads.<NL>...Would anyone seriously do that?
I take it you came to see the royal procession?
I do sometimes wonder what the Prince is thinking... He's still rather inexperienced to be running an empire...
However much they tell us to dress the same, we still want to be ourselves.
Master! I have cut that iron diamond to perfection!
You aren't from Hamelin, are you?<NL>Sorry, but this is as far as an outsider is going to get.
Hurry up, mun!<NL>We haven't got all flipping day!
Well, if ouer journey up till now's anything to go by, something proper scary's about to happen. There's comforting...
Come on, mun, to the palace with you!<NL>What's the holdup, eh?
Crikey! Not afraid of a bit of pomp and circumstance round by here, are they?
Flipping heck, mun!<NL>Which way is it to the palace again?<NL>My mind's gone even blanker than usual!
We've gone to all the trouble of getting ouerselves a boat. The least we could<NL>do is go for a flipping sail in it, mun!
A mechanical town, they call it. And this is the future? Hmph. I'm not sure this science thing will last.
They must be burning a heck of a lot of coal to drive all these contraptions. En't they worried it'll run out?
Look! The flipping lantern on my nose is covered in grime! The air here's filthy!
Look at the size of this place, mun! It's a heckuva long way to walk from the city gates to the palace.
Why pigs!?<NL>Does the Prince have a thing for porkers, or what?
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
Wahey!
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
What's up with you, eh?
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
Let's start the new day as we mean to go on, shall we? Best foot forward, and last one in's a rotten egg!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
Lay off for a bit, will you? Even us fairies need a bit of time to ouerselves now and again...
Want me to say something, do you? Sorry, mun, I got nothing for you. Not a sausage. Nada. Diddly-squat. Zero. Er...zilch.
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!

Enjoy exploring the other world!

Look both ways before you cross the road, you hear?
Hello, Mr. Cartwright.
Well, if it isn't young Oliver!<NL>What can I do for you, son?
Well, uh...I kinda need your help, Sir.<NL>Do you think you could fix this?
Well now, let me see... My, it's pretty worn down, whatever it is... What's it from?
Um... Gee... It's kinda, uh...
You'd rather not tell me, huh?<NL>Are you and Phil up to your tricks again?<NL>I'll bet you are...
So, um...can you fix it?
Sure. I'll give it a shot.
Y-You will?
On one condition—that you promise me you won't do anything dangerous like last time. Deal?
Yes, Sir! I promise!
...I think that oughta do it.<NL>Play safe now, you hear?
Don't let me hear about you getting into any more trouble, okay?
I just love to grow flowers!<NL>It's my favoritest hobby in the whole world!
I'd let you have some, but they're all dried up.
Growing flowers sure isn't easy, but they're so pretty when they open up their petals and say hi!
Hey, Mr. Drippy!<NL>This girl is...
That she is, my lad! Her and that little missy over by Perdida could be twins, mun! Soul mates, they are, or I'm a donkey's dad!
Huh? What do you want?
I have something to ask you. The flowers you grow...do you have any pink ones?
Sure! I have pink tulips!<NL>They're real pretty!
You do? Do you think you might let me have some?
I would, but they're all dried up.
Huh? Dried up?
Yup. Look.
Boy, they are kinda shriveled, huh?<NL>Mr. Drippy—is there anything we can do?
What are you asking me for?<NL>Youer the flipping wizard, en't you?
How am I s'posed to know if you've got a <color:#1>spell</color> that'll restore flowers to their former flipping glory?
Of course! I can use magic to bring them back!
Neato! The flowers came right back to life!
Wooow! You're amaaazing!<NL>That was like magic!
"Like magic," she says! The cheek of it!<NL>That was magic, love! The real deal!
Huh...?<NL>Did you hear something?<NL>I thought I heard somebody yelling...
No way, mun! She can hear me! HOW DO, LOVE? NICE WEATHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING, EN'T IT?
Mr. Drippy!<NL>Not now!
Hey, did you just hear a voice down near the ground there?
Uh...no. Guess it must have been the wind... Anyway, about those flowers—could I maybe have some?
Sure! But you have to promise to show me another magic trick next time!
"Trick"!? They're not tricks, mun!<NL>They're spells! Spells, you cheeky little—
That trick you did before was swell-o-riffic!<NL>I almost believed it was real magic!
Hey, you're not...<NL>Are you a real wizard?
They're all dried up, huh?
Use a <color:#1>spell</color> to bring them back to life, en't it!
Look at that! They're blooming blooming!<NL>There's beautiful! Nice one, Ollie-boy!
Where the heck am I, mun?<NL>Proper weird, this place is!
Uhh, this is Motorville. We're in my world.<NL>How did you get here?
Don't ask me, mun!<NL>I en't got the flipping foggiest!
There I was, running my fastest to get the heck out of Golden Grove, and the next thing I knows, I'm by here!
You must run pretty flipping fast...
Golden Grove is peaceful again, Mr. Fairy—you can go home now.
Is it? Is it indeed? You sure, now?<NL>You en't pulling my leg or nothing?
Nah, mun. We're dead serious. Consider youer leg unpulled, and use it to hop on home to Golden Grove, there's a good lad.
Tidy! That I will!<NL>Home, James!
...Hang on a mo! How the flip am I s'posed to get back, mun? I don't even know how I got over by here in the<NL>first place!
It's okay. We'll take you home.
You will? Well, I must say, that's very decent of you! I'll leave the travel arrangements in youer capable hands, then. Ta very much!
The kitchen, eh? Reckon there must be something by here we can use...
Oi, Ollie-boy—can you think of anything in here youer mam was proper fond of? Her weapon of choice, like...
Ummm... There's her frying pan, I guess... She used it every morning to make my eggs. She must have liked<NL>it a lot...
Her frying pan, eh? Eggs, you say...
Roll up, roll up... Use the very frying pan the Great Sage Alicia used to eggsact revenge on her foes...
"The flying frying pan"...<NL>Or maybe just "the flying pan"...<NL>Yeah, I reckon I can work with that...
.........
Yep, this'll do it. It'll be perfect, in fact!<NL>Tidy! Job done! Let's go, shall we?
...Uh, are you sure? It seems like kind of a goofy idea<NL>for a weapon...
Crikey... Just look at this kitchen, mun! Proper tidy, it is! Not like Mam's kitchen! Looks like a bomb's hit it, that place...
You got the idea for Mom's favorite pan!
Howdy, Oliver! I was thinking of taking the family to see a double-feature at the new drive in this weekend. Let me know if you want to join us!
Hey, Ollie!<NL>If you're looking for Phil, I haven't seen him this morning yet either.
Good day to you, Oliver!<NL>Your looking as perky as ever.
My, wouldn't owning an automobile be convenient. I'd like to go visit some of the neighboring towns, but I just don't feel inclined to walk.
Oh, gee... The car keys... Car keys...<NL>Gosh, I've gone and misplaced the car keys!<NL>Oh, gee... Look at the time!
The old folks here in Motorville are all cool cats. So you ought to grow into a fine upstanding citizen and make them proud!
Hey, welcome to Motorville! *hick* Thhe air ish clear and thhere are no bums...*hick*...it'sh a real neat plashe to live! ...Oh, hey, if it ishn't Oliver!
A new speakeasy just opened up near the town square up the road from here. It has a nice feel to the place.
When wine, women, and song get too much for me, I'll stop singing!
You've got to drink plenty of full-cream milk and eat plenty of red meat if you want to grow up healthy, son! That's why Leila's store is a big help!
Aww, shucks... My car's motor sounds a little off lately. And I only just bought her...
Perhaps it's the way I drive?
Lately I spend my breaks reading books in front of this shop. Oh, dang! I left my book in my car again...
Oh, hi again Oliver. I'm on my way to pick up my car I put in for servicing.
You know the place, the repair shop down the road south of here.
The chick in the house next door doesn't leave her house, but sometimes shows her face in the window. She's actually quite a looker.
Sorry to bother you again and again...<NL>Hopefully you've fixed her up for good this time.
If you ever get into any trouble again, let me know. I'll be there in a jiffy...no many how many times she breaks down!
Hey, kid! You shouldn't be loitering around here. You'll get me into trouble if you get hurt or something. So move along, now... Beat it!
Why if it isn't Oliver?<NL>I hope you are going to school and learning how to duck and cover!
I heard some of the townkids buit their own automobile, but that it got into an accident. Too bad as that expertise could serve them well in the future.
What are you looking at, kid? Haven't you seen a gas stand before?
What do you mean 20 cents a gallon is expensive?
Hullo, Ollie!<NL>You doing your daily constitutional now, too?
Woah, a gas-o-line stand!?<NL>No way...!
If only I had one of those new automatic washing machines, I'd hang out another load on the line just to make the most of this great weather.
Bow wow!<NL>Bow wow wow!
What's wrong with my dog? He seems to be barking at something behind you. Don't tell me it's a ghost or an invisible martian?
The kitty-cat in Leila's store sometimes seems to be chasing something.
Perhaps he spies a mouse...?
I guess they wouldn't be open at this time of day, huh?
The fireplace, mun! Downstairs in the flipping living room! Do you even flipping live here!?
Proper jaw ache, I've got! Waking up and having to do a huge great long explanation like that's a lot to ask of a fairy, even one as amazing as me!
Drippy, Lord High Lord of the Fairies, is back, mun! Back, and better than ever!
Putting youer name in and doing the pledge means that Wizard's Companion youer holding by there is youers and nobody else's. Look after it, mun!
You'll never guess whose name was in that Wizard's Companion before youers... Actually, forget I said anything. Sorry.
Had my butties back home doing all kinds of espionage, I did, and then they suddenly stopped getting in touch. I hope nothing horrible's happened...
Don't worry, mun! We'll find something somewhere round by here. Not sure where, like, but...somewhere...
Come on, mun. Let's go and look over by the other side, shall we?
Knickers. There's nothing remotely wandlike anywhere round by here, mun...
Ooh, youer first spell, eh! There's exciting!
En't we s'posed to be on ouer way to that town square place you mentioned?
Ahh, on my way home at last! Tidy!
First things first, let's get ouerselves down to Ding Dong Dell!
To the Deep Dark Wood!
This way, mun! This way!
You lost or something?<NL>Can't see youer way for the tears, is it?
Let's help that guard out, shall we?
We've got to get down to Ding Dong Dell, mun!
Pah! We finally get into Ding Dong Dell, and you come all the way back here! What are you thinking, mun?
Oi, you planning on standing out like a sore flipping thumb forever, mun? You need a new outfit, and I don't mean tomorrow...
Swift Solutions, we need. Does it look like we're going to find it here? Does it? Well, does it? I'll give you a hint—NO!
The Cat's Cradle's just there as you go into Ding Dong Dell, mun. What are we doing all the way out by here?
Come on, mun! Let's go and pick up youer new outfit! I can't wait to see what the old girl's thrown together for you...
All we need to do is head down to the palace in Ding Dong Dell. That should be easy enough, even for you!
We need to find that red herring sharpish, mun! Don't want it flipping and flopping all the way to the ocean now, do we?
Now we've caught the flipping thing, can we please hurry up and deliver it?
Who exactly were you planning on getting some enthusiasm off round by here then, hm?
Oi, Ollie-boy! En't we s'posed to be on the hunt for someone with enthusiasm to spare?
Planning on delivering that enthusiasm we found any time this century, are you?
Right, enough of the sightseeing! Let's get ouerselves down to the Cawtermaster's Stores, shall we?
Shouldn't we be over by the palace in Ding Dong Dell getting ouerselves a new wand?
Righto! Off to find ouer fat feline friend Timmy, en't it!
What's that? Who's my soul mate? Well, obviously, it's someone rich and handsome, en't it? Oi! What are you making that face for?
Why don't we ask youer Auntie Leila, Ollie-boy? She seems like a sensible starting place for this wild cat chase...
Cats en't exactly predictable, are they? In fact, they're proper flipping flibbertigibbets, if you ask me! Just don't ask me what "flibbertigibbet" means!
All we need to do is find that Timmy, and we'll know what's up with his Meowjesty back in Ding Dong Dell, en't it?
They do look alike though, eh, King Tom and old Timmy? Proper pair of fatties, they are!
Oi oi! Got an idea where he might be, have you? Tidy!
What's the rush, mun? Don't just run off without me!
Where the heck are you off to, mun? Youer not trying to get rid of me, are you? There's rude...
Don't worry, Timmy-boy, we'll have you carried back home in no time, won't we, Ollie-boy? You know, the both of us, like. Sharing the load... Ahh, forget it.
Flipping heck, Timmy-boy, youer not exactly svelte, are you? Ever thought of trying to lose a ton or two?
Oh yeah, guess who's doing the carrying yet again—Drippy the flipping carthorse! Just hurry up back to that shop, will you?
Reckon youer going to find him round by here, do you? I flipping don't!
To Ding Dong Dell, and down Ding Dong Well! That's where we need to be going, mun!
We finally get it open, and you come running off over by here! Youer a funny one, Ollie-boy, and no mistake...
What's the matter with you, eh?<NL>Shouldn't you be looking for the King?
Southward we go, to Golden Grove!
After Golden Grove, it's on to Al Mamoon!
Oi! En't you s'posed to be restoring the Spring of Life to its former glory?
En't we s'posed to be going and meeting that Rashaad bloke?
Crikey... To think the Great Sage Rashaad could end up like that... There's depressing.
It's all Shadar's fault, mun, this whole horrible potch everyone's in. Let's help those two out at least, eh? Breaks my heart to see them, it does.
Come on, Ollie-boy! To Motorville, and step on it! We've got to help that girl, en't it?
What's going on, Ollie-boy? Do you even know any girls, mun?
S'pose all we can do is run round like headless chickens till we find someone, eh?
You must know at least one girl, mun—or at least remember seeing one at least once in youer life...
Ha! She was right there the whole time! There's lucky!
Found her! And she's the spitting flipping image of that other girl! Tidy!
Let's get round to the front of that house, shall we, Ollie-boy?
Youer growing up more every minute, Ollie-boy. Very impressed, I am. Very impressed indeed...
Sounds like something funny's going on with this girl's family, en't it, Ollie-boy?
That lady we just spoke to—does she live over by you, mun? I haven't seen her around. But then I have been a doll the whole time, I s'pose...
Knickers! There must be some other way, mun...
There's frustrating. We'll just have to think of another way in, I s'pose... Hey! We could break a win— Er, no. Forget I said anything.
What now, Ollie-boy? Don't get all flustered—just take a deep breath and have a good think, en't it?
Pea? But you just went, didn't you?
What is it? You figured something out, have you?
Hang on, youer not going to suggest we smash the door down, are you, Ollie-boy? What would youer mam think of you behaving like that, eh?
You remembered he was Rusty, did you? Blimey, youer memory's better than mine, Ollie-boy. Going silly in my old age, I am...
It's no way for a girl to be, that, is it? Come on, Ollie-boy, we've got to help her, en't it?
You don't think she really did hear me, do you? ...Nah, mun, must have been my mind playing tricks, en't it?
Nightmares? Here in youer world!? What the flip's going on, mun!?
Go on, Ollie-boy, you know the drill! Cast the spell, mun!
Youer up, Ollie-boy! Get to it!
We've got to help Rusty, Ollie-boy! Come on!
What are you chatting with me at a time like this for!? Give over, mun!
Myrtle will want to know about this, en't it?
Ahh, there's lovely. Marital bliss is restored. Makes it all worthwhile, that does.
Come on, mun, we should give Myrtle the good news.
Let's get ouer bottoms in gear and get back to Al Mamoon, shall we?
Are you sure the Temple of Trials is this way?
What's wrong with you, mun?<NL>We need to go and see the Supreme Sage, en't it?
We're going nowhere fast until we pass those Trials, mun.
Come on, mun! Let's get down to the Temple and take that third Trial!
The Supreme Sage is waiting for us, en't he?
I know Solomon said to take a break, but that's no reason to go running off flipping miles away now, is it, mun?
We're s'posed to be heading for Al Mamoon, en't it?
We'll never stop that volcano from erupting if we don't get a flipping move on!
Reckon we've got a thing or two to be going and telling Rashaad, don't you?
Onward, to Castaway Cove!
We need to get after that dirty rotten thief, en't it?
Just going to let that stinking thief run off with the pot, are we?
Oi! Where are you off to, eh? The magic words for that pot are in the flipping Wizard's Companion, mun!
Come on, mun! Let's get down to Castaway Cove and set sail on the high seas!
We need to get that Cowlipha of Al Mamoon to let us borrow her boat, en't it?
Fancy taking a look at the Cat's Cradle they've got over in Al Mamoon? I hear it's a proper snazzy one.
What's Esther so upset about, mun? It's not like she's got a flipping lantern hanging off her nose, is it? There's worse people than royalty to look like...
You heading over to Leila's shop, are you? Tidy. Now we can find out what it is that floats that Cowlipha's culinary boat, en't it?
Doesn't exactly change much, this place, does it? S'pose that's part of its charm though, eh...?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, en't there?
Shift it, mun! Let's get back to Al Mamoon!
We need to head over to Al Mamoon and find us some restraint, mun!
Don't you like Al Mamoon or something?<NL>We need to head back there, mun!
Let's go and give old Cowface her restraint back, shall we?
If we head down to Castaway Cove, we should be able to ride that boat now, en't it?
Oi! We need to get back to Castaway Cove and retrieve ouer stolen goods!
Come on, mun! We need to go down to Castaway Cove and find us some restraint!
Let's go and hand over that restraint we got ouerselves, shall we?
That boat's going to leave without us if we don't get a flipping move on! Castaway Cove, and don't spare the ulks!
All aboard! Let's go and hit the high seas, en't it!
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
...Eh?<NL>Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.
We need to go and give those boys their pieces of art back, en't it.
S'pose we'd better go and make my mam laugh, eh?
Come on, mun! We need to get inside my mam, en't it?
We've got some unfinished business back inside my mam, mun!
We need to go and help those littlies!<NL>Pronto!
Come on, there's a slide in my mam's tum just waiting for us to go down it!
It's off to see the Empire, the wonderful Empire of Hamelin! In Autumnia!
Let's hurry up and get ouerselves to Hamelin, shall we?
D'you see any sages round by here?<NL>I flipping don't!
Reckon youer going to get some Hamelin armor round by here, do you? Well I flipping don't!
Oi, what do you think youer doing, ditching youer piggy armor and running off?
What exactly does this have to do with sneaking ouer way into the palace in Hamelin, hm?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?
We going back to the palace in Hamelin, or what, mun?
Let's get some belief off that Marcassin, shall we?
Come on, mun! Let's give Marcassin his belief back!
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
Itching to get over to Kublai's hideout, I am!
We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?
Let's hurry up and find that dragon's soul mate, shall we?
What sort of person shares their soul with a dragon, d'you reckon? Probably someone proper big and tough, eh?
Anyone spring to mind, Ollie-boy?<NL>S'pose we'd better just ask around, en't it?
That lady will know, won't she? You know, the Cowlipha's soul mate. Lovely old girl. Runs that shop, en't it? Let's go and ask by there.
Looks like that doggie's itching to talk to you, Ollie-boy. Use that spell you used on Tengri, en't it.
That little girl...could she hear me? I bet she could, and she was just ignoring me, the cheeky little so-and-so! Kids these days, mun! Don't know they're born...
That pooch is a proper fast runner, eh? S'pose he would be, running round town with no one to look after him...
Myrtle looks proper worried, eh, mun? We'd best go round this Denny boy's house and see what's what.
Just because people are soul mates, it doesn't mean they act the same. Worth remembering, that is. I often forget it myself...
Ha! Old Kublai's soul mate is a flipping dog, mun! And he's the spitting flipping image of old Pirateface, and all! There's hilarious!
Here, what about old Pirateface? He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
Tidy! Let's give Denny back his confidence then, shall we?
Blimey! Old Pirateface must have had way too much confidence, mun—the Locket's fit to flipping burst!
That thing round Denny's neck—is that a gold medal? There's marvelous...
Looks like we might have given the lad a bit too much confidence, mun. Did you see the way he ran off like that? Keen as flipping mustard, he is now!
We've not checked on Myrtle for a while, Ollie-boy. Let's pop to the shop and see how she's getting on.
Leaped clean over the fence, he did! Another broken heart mended by Dr. Drippy and his able assistant Oliver! Tidy!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
Let's find that last stone shall we, mun?
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!
What do you reckon's going on with that soldier from Xanadu over in front of the palace in Hamelin, eh?
Time to take a trip on old Tengri, I reckon!
Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
So Philip and that Pipsqueak are soul mates, are they? Should have known from the specs, en't it? It's obvious when you think about it!
Let's get on and find Philly-boy, shall we?
You've not seen Philip for a while now, have you, Ollie-boy? It'll be nice to catch up, eh?
Come on, Ollie-boy! Youer best butty's in a right old potch! We've got to help him out!
Youer the only one who can help Philip in his hour of need, Ollie-boy! Hurry up and save the day!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Give Phil a share of youer ambition! Quick!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Ahh, dear old Motorville! My home from home from home from home!
Where's that Pea to, eh? Youer the only one who can see her, en't it?
So who was it sent that manna stuff, then? Can't have been Shadar, can it? There's ominous...
Where's that Pea to, eh? Any ideas, Ollie-boy? I can't see her, so I'm relying on you, my lad.
So that Pea's coming with us, is she? Well, I still can't see her, so I'll just have to take youer word for it.
Where's that Pea to, eh?
Righto! Back to ouer world with you!
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
Watch the road, Ollie-boy! We don't want you getting squished now, do we?
Lived here youer whole life, have you?<NL>There's lovely. I've been all over, me...
There's shedloads of cars round by here, mun! Not that that's surprising I s'pose. This is Motorville, after all...
Reckon I might get myself a nice sports car, you know. Yeah, mun! Cruising round with the top down! Brrrm! ...Not that I can drive, mind.
I've spent so long over by here in youer world, it feels like my home from home! Reckon they'll let me become a citizen?
Wahey!
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
Let's start the new day as we mean to go on, shall we? Best foot forward, and last one in's a rotten egg!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
Lay off for a bit, will you? Even us fairies need a bit of time to ouerselves now and again...
Want me to say something, do you? Sorry, mun, I got nothing for you. Not a sausage. Nada. Diddly-squat. Zero. Er...zilch.
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.

...!<NL>.........!
Eh? What's up with you, mun?<NL>Look a bit pale, you do.
......!? .........!!!
Huh?<NL>You're giving this to me?
Well, fancy that! That's a page from the Wizard's Companion, that is. ...What's this little squirt doing with it?
......!!!<NL>............!?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.<NL>...Do you think he can't speak?
Nah, that's not it, mun. If I'm not very much mistaken...<NL>Yep! Must be!
Hm? Did you figure something out, Mr. Drippy?
That spell he just gave you—give it a try, Ollie-boy!<NL>You'll soon see!
Well, all right then...
......!!!
Get a move on, Ollie-boy!<NL>Give that spell he gave you a try, en't it!
Thank goodness! It worked!
Jeepers creepers!<NL>You can talk!
Of course I can talk, silly!<NL>You cast <color:#8>Spirit Medium</color> on me, didn't you?
So that's what it does, huh?
You mean to tell me you cast a spell without knowing what it did? What kind of a wizard are you?
For future reference, <color:#8>Spirit Medium</color> lets you speak to the spooky spirits of the dead. Like me!
So I was right!<NL>Youer a flipping ghost, en't it?
A gh-gh-ghost!? Jeepers...<NL>You mean to tell me that ghosts really exist?
Of course they do! Wizards see them all the time!<NL>I was a wizard too once, you know...
But thanks to that idiot the Dark Djinn, there aren't too many wizards left.
So when I saw you, I thought I'd better hand that page over. You're the first wizard I've seen in I don't know<NL>how long!
Jeepers...<NL>Can I really keep it?
Of course! It's the least I can do to say thanks for looking after my book.
...Your book?
Nah, you got youer wires crossed, sunshine.<NL>That's ouer book, that is. Who are you, anyway?
Me? I'm Horace! Although you probably know me better as the Sage of Ages!
Hang on a sec! You want us to believe a little midget like you is the Sage of flipping Ages?
Who are you calling a midget, pip-squeak?
I'm a fairy, en't it? I'm s'posed to be this size!<NL>Cheeky little...
You're called Ollie, are you?<NL>And you're on a journey in our world?
Uh, yeah.
Hmm... Maybe I'll go on a little journey myself...<NL>I haven't taken a look around our world for a long time.
...Right. I'm heading south to the desert.<NL>Hopefully we'll meet again at the town down there.
See you soon!
......<NL>.........!
The desert is off to the south of here.<NL>I'm going to head down there next.
.........<NL>......
Ollie, you're here at last!<NL>I've been waiting for ages!
Hi, Horace.<NL>Hey, this is...
This is where we met him in the first place.<NL>Seems like flipping ages ago, that does...
Hang on—didn't he say he'd come back to where we first met him when he remembered something?
Horace! Does this mean...your memory...?
...Not quite. But I did remember one thing.
What? What is it?<NL>Come on, mun, spit it out!
Ha ha. Patience, pip-squeak. Ollie, I bet you want to solve another riddle before I tell you, don't you?
Uh...I guess...
You see the monument here?<NL>It has some <color:#1>Nazcaän runes</color> on it.
They're a clue to something in the Wizard's Companion. Can you work out what it is?
Did you manage to <color:#1>decipher the Nazcaän runes</color>, Ollie?
You may not realize it, but you've learned it already...
That's right! Well done!<NL>I'm very impressed, Ollie!
All you had to do was combine two of the simplest spells—<color:#8>Form Familiar</color> and <color:#8>Gateway</color>—to make a super-duper one: <color:#8>Unleash</color>!
It's a reminder that no matter how far you go, you should never forget the basics.
And solving it is proof that you're ready to learn another super-duper spell...
Thank you, Horace!
All right, enough of the bighead talk—what was it<NL>you remembered?
...I remembered the ash.
Ash!? You mean...
So you know about the white ash that fell here too,<NL>do you?
That ash—the manna—it turned all the people into horrible monsters...
And when I saw it, I remembered...
That was how I died, too.
Jeepers!
Well I never...
A long, long time ago, the same ash fell...<NL>It killed us all...
...But that's all I remember.
Horace...
I heard that the big stone here was a monument to the Sage of Ages.
So I thought if I came here, it might help me to remember.
But I don't think this is where I died.
There's something else I need to remember...<NL>Something more important...
I'm going to carry on traveling.<NL>I need to find the place where I died.
Okay...
If I can find it, I think I might remember everything.<NL>I have to try...
See you again soon.
If I can find where I died in the ash, I might be able to remember everything...

Ahh, another fine day! I think I shall spend it lounging in the sunshine...
Ohh, my poor befuddled brain.<NL>Everything seems such a bother...
Is everything okay?
Ever since I woke up this morning, I just haven't been able to bring myself to do anything.
Nothing seems worth bothering with.<NL>Nothing at all...
Oh, come on, mun, there's plenty worth doing! Washing youer face, brushing youer teeth, and having a bit of breakfast, for a start!
But all those things are so...so...bothersome.<NL>...Can't I just leave them till later?
But if you leave them until later, when will your day<NL>ever begin?
Exactly! And if you don't get things done, they just keep on building up until youer in a right old pickle!
Really...?<NL>But I just can't be bothered...
That's no ordinary lazybones there, mun.<NL>This brokenhearted boyo's had every drop<NL>of <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> sucked right out of him.
If we can give him back his get-up-and-go, he'll stop putting things off, and start getting on with them again!
Youer not going to just leave him like this, are you,<NL>Ollie-boy? Youer a fine, upstanding wizard, after all!
But there's so much that needs doing, mun! Washing youer face, brushing youer teeth, and having a bit of breakfast, for a start!
Ohh, my poor befuddled brain...
Here, you've got a drop of <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> by there, en't it, Ollie-boy? Time to cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color>, I reckon!
Oh, my! Suddenly, I feel wide awake and full of life!
Neato! So you really weren't lazy, after all.<NL>You were just brokenhearted, huh?
I was...? (gasp) But this is terrible! I...I...<NL>I haven't even eaten my breakfast yet!
That's why my stomach is rumbling!<NL>And there are the fields to tend, too!<NL>Whatever have I been doing?
Not a lot, pal. Not a lot.
Ha ha ha! So it would seem. Well, I am awake at last.<NL>And it seems that I have you to thank.
Here. It isn't much, but please, accept this as a token<NL>of my thanks.
Now, to work! If I do my best, I can still make<NL>the day count!
Right! That's the laundry and the cleaning done, now for the shopping!
Haa... I think I'll just go home and have a nap...
Whatever has got into you?<NL>This is no time to be sleeping!
Oh, do be quiet...
It's my wife.<NL>She was such a busy bee until recently...
But now all she wants to do is sleep.<NL>She hasn't done a jot of work in days...
But it's all so tiring! The cleaning, the washing,<NL>the shopping... Ugh...
I'd much rather be having a nice doze than struggling to get through all of that...
Would you listen to her! Whatever happened to the determined young woman I married?
She suddenly got tired of it all, huh?
That's right. How could my dear, dedicated wife have become so...lifeless?
She must be brokenhearted, huh, Mr. Drippy?
That she must, Ollie-boy. And missing a healthy dose of <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, unless I'm very much mistaken...
Don't forget now, Ollie-boy: <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, and fast!
Don't be a heartless ape, mun!<NL>Give the pooer woman her enthusiasm back, will you?
It's all so tiring! The cleaning, the washing, the shopping... Ugh...
I think the lady here is missing a spot of the old <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, Ollie-boy. Brokenhearted, she is,<NL>and no mistake.
Whatever can be done?
Hm? Oh, my! What am I...?<NL>Whatever am I doing?
My dear! How do you feel?
Darling! Oh, goodness!<NL>What am I doing standing around like this?
I was about to do the shopping, wasn't I? If I don't hurry, we won't have so much as a scrap of stale bread to eat this evening!
Oh, my dear, dear wife!<NL>Back to her old self again!
Thank you! Thank you so much!<NL>Here, please, you must accept this.
Now, I must remember to get all the ingredients for that stew—and perhaps a pudding!
Ahh, my wife is such a busy bee!<NL>I do love her so!
What has got into you?<NL>You haven't done a jot of work in days!
Whatever happened to the determined young woman I married?
My beautiful, busy-bee wife is back!<NL>Thank heavens! I was so worried about her!
Time for another fun day at school!<NL>Purrfect!
Mmmyuh... School again...<NL>How purrfectly boring...
What's wrong? You know every kid has to go to school, right?
But it's such an awful lot of work...<NL>I just can't see the purrpose of it all.
Whatever's wrong with me, I wonder...? Until yesterday, I loved going to school and playing with the other children.
Uh-oh. Looks like we've got ouerselves a brokenhearted little lady.
Really? You think she's brokenhearted?
Do I ever. Lacking <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, she is, or I'm not tall and handsome! Well, Ollie-boy? Are you going to help her,<NL>or what?
Her friends must sure be worried about her, huh?<NL>And she can't go on cutting class...<NL>We have to do something!
Then it's <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>-hunting time for you, my lad!<NL>Get to it!
Leaving her in the lurch, is it? And the pooer dab's friends are probably worried sick about her, and all...
Looks like the pooer dab's lacking <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, Ollie-boy. Well? You going to help her, or what?
Righto, time to cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and serve up a dose of the old <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>!
Mmmyuh? What time is it? Oh no! I'm going to be late!<NL>How purrfectly terrible!
Then you should get going! I bet your friends can't wait to see you at school!
I will! Thank you, boy!
Oh—here. It's a little purresent to say thanks!<NL>Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I can't wait to get to school and play with everyone! Mmmyay!
Why won't it hurry up and be tomorrow?<NL>I can't wait to go to school and play!
Come on! Hurry up, or we'll be late for school!
Fine! I'm going without you!
Oh no! I'm going to be late, too!<NL>Come on, we have to run!
Come, we must protect our fields from the menace of the ravenous ruffs!
I'm just not cut out for monster hunting...<NL>Maybe it's time I called it a day...<NL>The soldier's life just isn't for me anymore.
But, Sergeant! Why would you say such a thing,<NL>all of a sudden?
It's the Sergeant. He's suddenly started talking about giving up soldiering.
I just don't have any fight left in me.<NL>And the beasts...they scare me....
Don't say that! What has happened to you?<NL>You used to be the bravest of us all!
Huh? Say, Mr. Drippy, you don't think the Sergeant's lost his <color:#1>courage</color>, do you?
He certainly seems brokenhearted, en't it?<NL>What do you want to do about it, Ollie-boy?
Leave it to us! The Sergeant will be a brave soldier again soon, I promise!
Do you really think you can help him?
No sweat, mun! We'll go and grab a bit of <color:#1>courage</color>, and be back before you know it!
Really? Fair enough, I s'pose...if you think he'll be all right, I mean...without a speck of <color:#1>courage</color> to his name...
It's the Sergeant. He's suddenly started talking about giving up soldiering. And to think he used to be the bravest of us all!
Say, Mr. Drippy, you don't think the Sergeant has lost his <color:#1>courage</color>, do you?
Here, you've got some <color:#1>courage</color>, en't it?<NL>Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over, why don't you?
Hm? Why, whatever's going on here?<NL>We should be out on patrol!
Sergeant! You're back!
Neato!<NL>We saved him, huh?
Thank you so much! I don't know how you managed it, but the Sergeant's back to his old self!
It's not much, but please, accept this by way of thanks.
Come, we must protect visitors to our realm from the scourge of the sleepeafowl!
What has happened to you?<NL>You used to be the bravest of us all!
Let's have a race to school!<NL>I bet I'll lick you easily!
Mmmyoh, go away!<NL>I can walk to school on my own!
What's wrong?<NL>Why don't we walk together like normal?
Are you being annoying on purrpose?<NL>Just shut up and go away!
Hey, that's no way to talk to your friend!
Mmmyugh! What's it got to do with you? You should both learn to stop sticking your big noses in where they're not wanted!
Hey, don't talk like that!<NL>Wouldn't it be fun to walk to school with your friend?
I'd have more fun changing my litter tray!<NL>Go away!
Not again! (sigh) ...She is though, eh?<NL>Brokenhearted, I mean.
This time, it's <color:#1>kindness</color> she's lacking. Reckon you've guessed that already, though...
You'll save the day again, won't you, Ollie-boy?
If she goes on upsetting people like this, she won't have any friends left. We have to do something!
Leaving her in the lurch, is it?<NL>There's selfish...
Hey, don't talk like that! Wouldn't it be fun to walk to school with your friend?
There's no mistaking the brokenheartedness on this little one. Missing a bucket or two of <color:#1>kindness</color>, she is.
Why should I walk to school with you?<NL>You can go on your own, can't you?<NL>You're not a little baby! Mmmyugh!
Here, you've got some <color:#1>kindness</color> in the Locket by there, en't it? Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over, will you?
Mmmyuh? What am I doing? ...Sorry for being mean to you. I didn't do it on purrpose.
Are you back to normal?<NL>Hooray! Thank goodness!
Looks like you're okay now.<NL>Be nice to your friends now, won't you?
I will, I purromise! It was you who helped me, wasn't it? Just like before, I mean... Here. This is for you.<NL>Thank you so much!
Come on! Let's walk to school together! There's nothing like a lovely purromenade with your best friend, after all!
All right! I won't let you beat me, though!<NL>On your marks... Get set...
What's happened to her?<NL>She was so nice until yesterday...
Yay! Come on!
The Great Tug-o'-Tail Tournament begins soon... I had better start purracticing.
Mmmyooohhh nooo... It begins so soon...<NL>What shall I do? I just can't face it...
Say, is something wrong? You seem sorta...worried.
Mmmyooohhh, I am, I am...<NL>The Great Tug-o'-Tail Tournament begins soon...
And that's a bad thing, is it?
Well, I have to purrticipate, you see.
And everyone expects me to do well, but I just know I'll be terrible! I'll put in a paw purrformance, and everyone will laugh!
Well, if youer that worried about it, can't you just make youer excuses and pull out?
Mmmyooohhh nooo, I can't... I won last year by a whisker, you see, and the champion has to enter...
Huh? You're the champion?<NL>Then how come you're scared to take part?
I know why, Ollie-boy. It's because a certain nasty piece of work has stolen ouer pooer friend's <color:#1>confidence</color>, en't it?
He'll never win in a state like this.<NL>Pitiful, it is. What shall we do?
Tidy! That's the spirit, Ollie-boy!<NL>Now let's bag us a locketful of <color:#1>confidence</color>!
Oh, like that, is it? Well, I s'pose it's not the end of the world, but still...
Mmmyooohhh nooo... The Great Tug-o'-Tail Tournament begins so soon... What shall I do? I just know I'm going to put in a paw purrformance...
If youer that worried about it, can't you just make youer excuses and pull out?
Myooohhh nooo... It's no good...<NL>I'll never win it in my state...
Looks like youer ready to cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and restore ouer friend here's <color:#1>confidence</color>. And not a moment too soon...
Mmmyuh? I... What am I doing here? I should be purracticing for the Great Tug-o'-Tail Tournament!
Neato! You got your confidence back!<NL>Good luck in the tournament!<NL>We'll be cheering for you!
I have you to thank for this, don't I? I am in your debt.<NL>Here, a little purresent to say thank you.
Ahh, you travel with familiars, I see.<NL>Try feeding them this. They'll lap it up!
And they may even grow up to be as strong as me—<NL>the purrfect warrior!
I'll need to start purracticing soon if I'm going to retain my tug-o'-tail title!
Oh, it's you! It's so good to see you again!<NL>I have something to tell you—soon we'll have enough money to open our shop at last!
There's still a lot to do, but with a loving wife beside me, there's nothing I can't achieve!
I'm sorry... I don't know what's happened, but...<NL>I don't think we can be together anymore...
Darling! Y-You can't be serious!<NL>Our dreams were about to come true!<NL>Why would you throw it all away?
Has something happened?
Oh, it's you. For some reason, my husband has started acting as if he wants to get rid of me.
I'm sorry, I really am...<NL>I don't hate you, it's not that, it's just...
We just can't be together anymore.<NL>It's... It's not you, it's me.
Jeepers... But they make such a swell couple...<NL>Why would he...?
Use youer eyes, Ollie-boy!<NL>It's obvious, en't it?
Hm? Of course!<NL>He's heartbroken, huh?
Too right he is! He's had the <color:#1>love</color> stolen from his heart, en't he? Proper tragic, it is! You'll help, won't you?
Sure I will, Mr. Drippy!<NL>Let's go find some <color:#1>love</color>!
Really? There's sad.<NL>Well, I s'pose you have youer reasons...
Haa... What's wrong with me?<NL>I just don't want to be with my wife anymore...
Come on, Ollie-boy! Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and bring the <color:#1>love</color> back into their lives!
...Hmm? Where am I...?
Are you okay?
Huh? Oh, it's you.<NL>I must have had another funny turn.
My head is all in a muddle, and my memories are completely mixed up.
But you don't want to dump youer wife anymore,<NL>en't it, though?
"Dump" her? Leave her, you mean?<NL>My dearest darling wife!? Never!<NL>I love her more than life itself!
Eurgh, come on, mun, for shame! I've only just had my lunch! ...S'pose that means he's better though, eh?
Thank you! Thank you so much!<NL>Here, this is for you.
I don't think we can be together anymore.<NL>I just need some time on my own.
Not again...
But we've come so far...<NL>Was it something I did?
Ahh, now we can open our dream shop at last!
So, we meet again.<NL>It must be fate.
Just a little longer, and our dreams will be realized at last! Let's keep up the good work!
Haa............
But dear, we're inches away from our dream coming true at last! What's the matter with you?
Nothing's the matter, I just... I just think this whole shop thing might be no more than a silly fantasy...
Wh-What's wrong? Are you two fighting?
Not exactly, it's just...well, my wife has started acting strangely all of a sudden.
Until yesterday, she was all fired up about our dream of owning a shop, but suddenly she's changed her mind...
Oh dear, dear me. Loss of shared goals? Sudden mood swings? Classic signs of a marriage on the rocks,<NL>those are...
Mr. Drippy!
I was only joking, like...
She's obviously heartbroken, en't it?<NL>Lost her <color:#1>ambition</color>, she has!
They're so close to achieving their dream...<NL>We have to help them the last step of the way!
That's the spirit, Ollie-boy!<NL>Now get out there and grab some <color:#1>ambition</color>!
Have a heart, mun! Pooer things...
I just think this whole shop thing might be no more than a silly fantasy...
But you've worked so hard to make it this far.<NL>Are you really going to give up now?
Pah, who cares about all that stuff?
Again? Are you serious!?
She's gone and got herself brokenhearted again! Lost her <color:#1>ambition</color>, she has!
You got some <color:#1>ambition</color> there, en't it?<NL>Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over!
I... Our shop... Our dream shop...
Aah! What am I doing!? There's no time to waste!<NL>We have to sell, sell, sell!
She's back! My dear, darling wife is back!
All better, looks like! Tidy!
Neato! Now they can realize their dream together at last!
Thank you so much for your help!<NL>Here, take this—it's the least we can do.<NL>And be sure to visit when the shop opens!
Oh, and we've collected a few alchemy formulae on our travels, too. Here.
I'm sure they'll be of more use to you than they will to us.
This whole shop idea is just a silly pipe dream...
Just a little longer! We'll have to tighten the purse strings, but it'll be worth it!
Oh dear. Looks like it's my wife's turn to have a<NL>funny turn...
It's not a pipe dream!<NL>We can do it if we work together!
You're forever getting us out of trouble.<NL>Thanks so much for all your help.
Oh, it's you!<NL>Just a little longer until our shop opens, and you can marvel at our bargain prices!
You received some new alchemy formulae!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
This shop is called Swift Solutions. It's the purrfect place to come if you want to help the needy. They give out tasks to adventurers.
Have you come to volunteer for a task? If so, be careful—they can be very hard if you're not purroperly purrepared.
Thanks for the tip.<NL>Are you here to volunteer, too?
Indeed I am. I wanted something I could really get my claws into, so I've signed up for a bounty hunt.
All by yourself? Jeepers, that's awful brave of you!
There's no need to worry, purrovided you're careful.<NL>I just want to do my bit to purrotect the peace of<NL>Ding Dong Dell.
And on top of that, I'm just full to the whiskers with fighting spirit lately! I can't wait to get out there and lick a baddie or two!
Full to the whiskers, is it? There's marvelous!<NL>How's that for <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, eh, Ollie-boy?
Oh, you mean...
That's right! Ouer friend here's got enthusiasm to spare. Go on, ask him if he'll give us a lend of it.
Sure! Uh, excuse me, would you mind awfully if we borrowed some of your enthusiasm?
Borrow some? I'm surpurrised that such things are<NL>even possible... But if it's in my power to lend, then<NL>by all means!
Thank you very much!
Oh, my! I feel even better than before!<NL>I'm off to hunt that bounty!<NL>Purrepare to die, fiends!
Have you come to volunteer for a task?<NL>I wanted something I could really get my claws into, so I've signed up for a bounty hunt.
All by yourself?<NL>Jeepers, that's awful brave of you!
Well, I've been full to the whiskers with fighting spirit lately! I can't wait to get out there and lick a baddie or two!
This fine fellow's got <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> and then some!
He sure does!<NL>Uh, excuse me, would you mind awfully if I borrowed some of your enthusiasm?
Borrow some? I'm surpurrised that such things are even possible... But if it's in my power to lend, then by all means!
You must take on as many tasks as you can, and bring hope to those in need! It's every hero's purrpose in life!
Hey, did you know that it's the Great Tug-o'-Tail Tournament soon? I can't wait to give everyone a licking!
What's tug-o'-tail?
What? What kind of purrson doesn't know what<NL>tug-o'-tail is?
Uhh, me, I guess...<NL>Have you heard of it, Mr. Drippy?
'Course I have, mun! Tug-o'-tail's the most popular pastime in all of Ding Dong Dell.
That's right! And there's a big tournament soon!<NL>It's my chance to finally purrove myself!
I didn't win a single match last time, but I can't wait to<NL>try again!
Can't wait, eh? There's marvelous!
I'm going to put on the purrformance of a lifetime!<NL>I suppose I'd better start purracticing...
Mr. Drippy, do you think...?
I most certainly do, Ollie-boy.<NL>Overflowing with <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, he is.
Say, I don't suppose you'd mind if we borrowed some of your enthusiasm?
Borrow it? How can you borrow it?<NL>Sounds purretty strange to me...
Mmmyah, who cares!? I'm curious! Go fur it!
Thank you!<NL>Okay, just hold still a moment...
How strange... My chest feels all fluttery...<NL>Anyway, I'd better think about purracticing!
It's the Great Tug-o'-Tail Tournament soon!<NL>I didn't win a single match last time, but I can't wait to try again!
Can't wait, eh? There's marvelous!<NL>Overflowing with <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, this one is!
Borrow it? How can you borrow it?<NL>Sounds purretty strange to me...<NL>Mmmyah, who cares!? I'm curious! Go fur it!
I'd better start doing some tug-o'-tail purractice!
Ahh, another fine day!<NL>And soon I shall be off to work!
Boy, you sure are full of beans!<NL>What line of work are you in, Mister?
Hm? Me? Oh, I'm just a humble woodcutter.
En't youer job a bit dangerous, what with all the beasties roaming round outside town?
A little perhaps, but there's a shortage of wood here in Ding Dong Dell.
If I don't go out and work my hardest, our dear town will suffer. What's a little danger compared to that, hm?
What an answer! There's heroic!<NL>Oi, Ollie-boy—
Uh-huh! He's got <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> to spare, huh?
Ho ho ho! You flatter me!
Uh, this may sound a little odd, Sir...but would you mind if we borrowed some of it?
Of course not! Anything!
Thank you!
Ho ho ho! That tickles!<NL>Now, to work!
I will work my hardest for the sake of our town, and to blazes with any monsters that get in my way!
Crikey, there's <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> for you!
Could we please borrow some of your enthusiasm, Mister?
Hm? Borrow my enthusiasm? Ho ho ho!<NL>Why, you may borrow whatever you please, lad!
Thank you very much, Sir!<NL>Could you hold still for just a moment?
Hm? Oh, my!
Ahh, another fine day!<NL>I just can't wait to get to work!
I have to keep it a secret from everybody...
Tee hee hee! He looks much healthier now!<NL>Not long until he's all better. But I have to keep it a secret from everybody until then...
What are you doing there?
Eek! You gave me a fright! It— It's a secret, what I was saying just then, all right?
Huh? What was? Sorry, I wasn't listening.<NL>What's a secret?
Umm, oh... Well... You see...<NL>I found this poorly baatender.
And I've been looking after him, and keeping it secret from everybody.
A baatender? That's some kind of critter, huh?<NL>Isn't that a little dangerous?
He's not dangerous! He's a good little lambkin!<NL>He was frightened of me at first, but now we're best friends!
Crikey! Fancy making friends with a wild beast!<NL>There's not many have the knack for that!
But there's kind, eh, taking care of his wounds and everything?
It sure is.<NL>She must have a heart just full of <color:#1>kindness</color>...
You'll keep it secret won't you?<NL>Mummy will be so angry if she finds out...
Sure we will.<NL>But we have a favor to ask you too, okay?
All right. What is it?
Could you hold real still for just one second?
Ooh, my chest feels all light... Right, I'd better go and look after my little lambkin!
I found a hurt baatender and looked after him.<NL>He's a very good boy, though! He would never hurt me—we're best friends!
Crikey! Fancy making friends with a wild beast!<NL>She must have some serious <color:#1>kindness</color>, doing that...
Say, would you mind if we borrowed some of your kindness, little girl?
No, I don't mind.<NL>But what do I have to do?
Oh, nothing.<NL>Just hold real still for one second...
I'll have to let my lambkin go back into the wild soon... I don't want him to go...
My husband is a brave explorer, but it means he's away all the time.
(sigh) I hope he comes home soon...
Is everything okay, Ma'am?<NL>You look sorta...distracted.
Oh, well it's my husband, you see.<NL>He's an explorer.
He's often away for months on end. And this time he's gone somewhere very dangerous. I haven't heard from him in two years...
Jeepers!<NL>Two whole years!?
Ooh, there's lonely!
But I'm not worried—he's the greatest explorer in the world, after all.
No matter what happens to him, he'll always find his way home to me.
You really believe in your husband, huh?
You can say that again! What a cracking missus! Youer my kind of wife, you are—full to the brim with <color:#1>belief</color>!
Hm hm. Thank you. I'm sure I'll hear that he's discovered a whole new continent any day now!
Uh, say, Ma'am... We have a favor to ask...<NL>Would you mind?
A favor? What kind of favor?
You'd sure be helping us an awful lot if you'd let us borrow some of your belief...
Borrow my belief?<NL>By all means—that sounds like fun!
Hm hm! That tickles! Oh, but my heart feels...all aflutter!<NL>How lovely!
My husband is a brave explorer, and no matter how far away he goes, I know he'll always come home to me.
Ahh, youer my kind of wife, you are—full to the brim with <color:#1>belief</color>!
You wouldn't say no to us having a borrow of a bit of it now, would you?
Borrow my belief?<NL>By all means—that sounds fun!
Really? Tidy! Ta!<NL>Hop to it, Ollie-boy!
I can feel it in my bones...<NL>I just know he'll be home soon.
Welcome, young man.<NL>Would you like some delicious fruit?
And what about some lovely vegetables, hm?<NL>Our produce is the finest there is!
Oh, boy! It all looks so tasty!
Doesn't it just, hm?<NL>And all picked fresh this morning!
I won't say it doesn't all look good, like, but it's a bit on the pricey side, en't it?
Of course! This isn't just any old shop, you know!<NL>We take pride in our produce!
You won't find tastier anywhere in the whole world!
The tastiest in the whole wide world?<NL>Boy, I sure would love to try some!
Hey look, the Locket's glowing...
I'm not surprised! You don't come across <color:#1>confidence</color> like that every day!
I guess you don't, huh? Uh, excuse me, Ma'am, do you think you could help me?
Certainly, dear, what will it be? Some nice apples, perhaps?<NL>A turnip or two?
Um, no, I meant, uh...
You don't want any of our delicious produce?<NL>Then what is it, hm?
Well, if it's all right with you, Ma'am, I'd like to use your confidence to help people who don't have enough of<NL>their own...
Oh, is that all? Of course, dear!<NL>Take as much as you want!
Really? Thank you very much!
Do you really think you can use it to help people? Whatever will they think of next...?
Our vegetables are the tastiest in town!<NL>In fact, they're the tastiest in the world!<NL>I know, because I grow them myself!
She's not short of a bit of <color:#1>confidence</color> is she, this one? Shall we get some off her?
Sure. Let me ask her.
If it's all right with you, Ma'am, I'd like to use your confidence to help people who don't have enough of their own...
Hee hee hee! Whatever do you mean?<NL>What a funny thing to ask!<NL>But of course, dear, go ahead!
Really?<NL>Thank you very much!
Welcome, welcome!<NL>Try our delicious produce!
Hmm... With which of the princesses of my heart shall I spend this fine, fine day?
Oh, woe is me... I cannot possibly decide...<NL>Such a cruel, cruel choice... Oh me, oh my...
Crikey, you sound like youer in a right old pickle.<NL>What's the matter, mun?
Zounds! You heard my pitiful cries of agony?
Uh, yes, we did. What's wrong, Mister?<NL>You said you had a difficult choice to make?
Forsooth! It seems that in this kingdom of prudes and priggish stiff necks, a man may marry but a single,<NL>solitary maiden!
Yet I love all the damsels of the land—nay, all the ladies of this fair world!
To choose only one flower from such a bountiful garden—why, it is impossible! Impossible, I say!
.........
Hey, look—the Locket is glowing. Do you think maybe this gentleman has too much <color:#1>love</color> in his heart?
Pah, not enough restraint, more like!
But look, it's glowing. That must mean...
Does something trouble thee, friend?
Uh, no... I was just wondering...<NL>Would you like to help us help someone?
If you could let us have a little of the love in your heart, we could give it to someone who doesn't have enough...
Hmm... This person who wants for love...<NL>Is she a fair maiden?
Um, I guess she could be, sure...
Then let it be so! I will gladly sacrifice a morsel of my most precious love for the sake of a damsel in distress!
Uh, thank you.
Farewell! I eagerly await the day when my fabled love proves the salvation of all the beauties of this fair and virtuous world!
I love all the damsels of the kingdom—nay, all the maidens of this fair world!
Excuse me, Sir—may we have a little of the <color:#1>love</color> in your heart to give to someone who doesn't have enough?
Oh, woe is me... Such a cruel, cruel choice...
Mmmyohhh... Which pot did I put it in again?
Mmmwell, it's my purrecious treasure, you see...<NL>I can't remember which pot I hid it in.
Gee, that's tough.<NL>What sort of treasure is it?
My grandmother's <color:#1>red earring</color>.<NL>It's such a purretty color...
You couldn't lend me a paw and help me look for it,<NL>could you?
You will? Purrfect!
It's <color:#1>in one of those pots</color> you see around town.
Inside one of the pots, huh?<NL>Leave it to me!
You're a purrfect gentleman!
Mmmyoh... But I'll never be able to find it unless someone lends me a paw...
Tut-tut, Ollie-boy! There's cold!<NL>Pooer dab's proper upset, en't it?
I hid my purrecious <color:#1>red earring</color> in a pot somewhere, but I can't remember which one. It's a really purretty color...
Gee, that's tough...<NL>You can't remember at all?
My mind's a purrfect blank, I'm afraid.<NL>You couldn't help me look, could you?
My purrecious <color:#1>red earring</color> is hidden <color:#1>in a pot somewhere</color>. Please lend a paw and help me find it!
Mmmyoh my! You've got it!<NL>You've got my earring!
Oh, that's purrfect, just purrfect!<NL>You found it for me!
We sure did.<NL>Don't lose it again now, okay?
I purromise! I'll never lose it again!
Oh, here. This is a purresent for you.<NL>Thank you so much!
I purromise I'll never lose my earring ever again!<NL>Never ever ever!
Mmmyohhh...<NL>It's still not quite purretty enough...
Doing a bit of decorating, is it? Well, I always say you can't beat a flower or two! Brighten things up no end, they do!
How clever of you! I was just thinking about using some flowers! I'm trying to make my doorway purrettier, you see.
You are? What kind of flowers are you thinking of using?
Mmmwell, now... I want something nice and bright...<NL>And I'll need some fresh, clean water to give them, too.
Mmmyaha! I know, you can help me!<NL>Can you spare the time? Purretty please?
Oh, thank you! You're a purrfect gentleman!
Now, I'll need you to bring me <color:#1>two plainswort flowers</color> and <color:#1>two bottles of springwater</color>, all right?
Yes, Ma'am!<NL>Oh, but where can we find them?
Mmmyes... Neither can be purrchased from the shops... You'll have to go and look for them out among the<NL>Rolling Hills.
Mmmyoh, don't worry—they positively twinkle! I daresay you've seen <color:#1>twinkling spots</color> on the ground outside town, haven't you?
Well, be sure to investigate them when you stumble upon one—you'll find all manner of purrecious things.
Mmmyoh, and one more thing...
Once you forage from a purrticular spot, it won't twinkle as it did before. But never fear—both its purroduce and its twinkle will return in time!
Got it! Thank you, Ma'am! We'll head on out of town and keep our eyes peeled for some of these...uh...twinkles.
Tidy! Let's go a-foraging then, shall we?
Thank you very much, you're a pair of purrfect<NL>little gentlemen!
Mmmyohhh, that's a shame. And I was going to teach you something useful, too...
I'm trying to make my doorway purrettier, and I'm thinking I might use some flowers.
You are? What kind of flowers?
Plainswort blooms in the hills <color:#1>to the southeast of town</color>, and springwater can be found <color:#1>beside rivers and lakes</color>.
Mmmyoh my! You've found it all already!
Yes, Ma'am! Are these the things you were looking for?
Oh, yes! Purrfect, just purrfect!<NL>I'm ever so grateful, dear.
Here, a little purresent to say thank you.
There are foraging spots dotted all over the world. You should investigate them whenever the oppurrtunity purresents itself.
Goodness me! Wherever have those little rascals run<NL>off to now?
Is something the matter, Ma'am?
It's my boys. The <color:#1>three of them</color> are forever running off and not coming back!
I know they're just playing, but I can't help thinking they'll hurt themselves...
You worry about them a lot, huh?
Yes, I do. And today they're even later than ever.<NL>I'm beside myself!
Ahh, a mother's life is never easy, no matter where you<NL>go, eh?
You don't have a spare moment, do you?<NL>Could you go and find my boys for me?
I'm sorry to put you to such trouble... But if you could let me know when you've found them, I'd be ever so grateful.
Well, that's not very nice, is it?<NL>You should help others in need, you know.
Is something the matter?
It's my boys. The <color:#1>three of them</color> have run off and not<NL>come back.
You don't have a spare moment, do you?<NL>Could you go and find them for me?
Thank you so much.<NL>I'm sure they're fine, but you know how it is...
You helped my boy, didn't you?<NL>Thank you so much!<NL>You don't know what it means to me!
I hope you find the other two soon!
I hope finding my other boy doesn't take up too much of your time!
Thank you so much for finding all three of my boys!
And you patched the little rascals up as well!<NL>You're a treasure! An absolute treasure!
I'm just glad we could help.
Oh, I can't wait until they grow up a little and calm down!
Here, this is to say thank you!<NL>Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You must come and play with my boys the next time you're in Ding Dong Dell.
My boys are just too lively for their own good! They're forever running off and hurting themselves.
Still, better to be too lively than not lively enough, I suppose...
Waaaaaah! It huuurts!
Aww, look! Pooer dab's gone and hurt himself.<NL>Must be one of that lady's lost boys.<NL>We'd better patch him up, eh?
Jeepers, that looks painful... But what can we do, Mr. Drippy? We don't have a first aid kit...
Crikey, Ollie-boy!<NL>Brain like a flipping sieve, you've got!
Youer a wizard, en't it! Use some flipping magic!
Oh, um...sure... What do I, uh...?<NL>Which spell do I use, Mr. Drippy?
For crying out loud, mun! I'm only telling you this<NL>once, right? <color:#8>Healing Touch</color>, mun! Got it?<NL><color:#8>Healing flipping Touch</color>!
You said it twice...
Oooooow! It huuurts!
O-Okay, here goes!<NL>I'm going to fix you up, okay?
...Hm? It doesn't hurt anymore!<NL>Hooray! I'm all better!
Listen, sunshine—youer pooer mother's worried sick about you, right? Get on home with you!
I will, I promise!<NL>Thank you for making me better!
Waaah! I fell over and hurt my arm...<NL>It huuurts...
Hey, don't cry!<NL>I'll fix you right up. Here...
...Hm? It's not hurting!<NL>It's not hurting anymore!
There's tidy, eh?<NL>That's magic for you.
Magic? Really?<NL>Wooow! Amazing!
That's right. Your mommy was worried about you, so she sent a wizard to tell you to go on home right now!
Yes, Mr. Wizard, I will!<NL>Thank you!
Owowowowowow!<NL>I tripped over and hurt my leg...
Gee, are you okay?<NL>Hold still just a second—I'll fix you right up.
Wow! It doesn't hurt at all now!<NL>That's amazing! Are you a wizard?
I sure am! Your mommy sent me to find you.<NL>She's worried about you.
Really? All right, I'll go straight home, then.<NL>Thank you for doing magic on me!
Waaah! I fell over and grazed my knee!<NL>Owwwwww!
Hey now, don't cry! Let me fix you up...
...Huh? It's not hurting anymore!
That's right. All better! There's marvelous!
Youer mother's worried sick about you.<NL>Run along home now, there's a good lad.
I will, I promise! Thank you very much!
You made me all better with magic! Magic's amazing!
You're a wizard! That's amazing!
Thanks very much, Mr. Wizard!
Thank goodness he's back to his old self at last. Now we can get back to the old routine.
Ahh, what to do, what to do...?<NL>How could I have been so careless...?
You don't look so happy.<NL>Is everything okay?
It most certainly is not! My beloved <color:#1>Cat's Whiskers</color> have been stolen!
Your cat's whiskers!?
That's right. King Tom awards them to only the most deserving of his guardsmen.
Jeepers, and you've lost them?
I have not lost them! Didn't you hear me? They were stolen! Look—the culprit's footprints are just there!
They are as well...<NL>Hang on a mo—these aren't human footprints!
No...they aren't. You see, the thief was...well... Look, the thief was a particularly wily creature of the wild, all right? Happy now!?
Oh, if my fellow guards ever find out, I shall never live this down...
Please, you must help me! Will you hunt down the beast who stole my <color:#1>Cat's Whiskers</color>?
You will?<NL>Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!
I cannot leave my post, you see...
No worries, mun! With the legendary Inspector Drippy on the case, you'll have youer treasure back in no time flat!
Just follow the footprints, and you'll soon find the thief. Please, you must hurry!
You won't?<NL>But there's no one else I can ask...
This is terrible news! It's an emergency! My <color:#1>Cat's Whiskers</color> have been stolen by some criminal creature!
Youer cat's whiskers!? Well that's not exactly the end of the flipping world, is it? They'll grow back, mun!<NL>Get over it!
No, not my cat's whiskers! My set of commemorative Cat's Whiskers! Awarded to me by King Tom himself!
Please, you must help me! Will you hunt down the beast who purloined my <color:#1>Cat's Whiskers</color>?
Just follow the footprints, and you'll soon find the culprit. Please, you must hurry!
Hey, we got your whiskers back.<NL>Sorry it took us so long...
Oh my, oh my, oh my!<NL>My beloved Cat's Whiskers!<NL>Thank you! Thank you!
I, I don't know how I can ever repay you...
Just don't get them pinched again, all right?
No, no, I shan't, I shan't!<NL>They'll never leave my sight again!<NL>Not for a single second!
Oh, and I must give you a reward.<NL>Here, please accept this...
They won't get stolen again, on my honor!
They look like someone's footprints...
The footprints lead out of town...
Well, this certainly isn't ideal...<NL>Not at all...
Gee, Derwin. I don't think I've seen you like this before... Is something the matter?
Oh, Oliver. It's you. I suppose it was a statistical certainty that our paths would eventually cross again...
Since you ask, I'm in what you might call a bit of a pickle.
What is it, mun? Tell youer old friend Drippy, Lord High Lord of the Fairies.
Very well. You see, the creatures upon which my studies currently focus are of an extremely ferocious disposition.
Jeepers! I bet that makes them difficult to catch, huh?
I think you'll find it makes them entirely impossible<NL>to catch.
And as a result, they can only be studied once they have been subdued in combat.
Of course, a researcher of my standing is in no position to risk his extremely valuable neck tackling such beasts.
Say no more, mun. We get the picture.<NL>What do you say, Ollie-boy?
Sure, Derwin, we'll help you!
Excellent.<NL>You offered, just as I predicted you would.
Eh? So you planned this whole thing, is it?
Sure he did! You always do, huh, Derwin?<NL>Boy, you sure are smart!
Well, I am the foremost mind of a generation.<NL>Your help is very much appreciated, of course.
I need you to defeat three creatures altogether.
The first is of the species <color:#1>grubby fug</color>. Its habitat is the island of <color:#1>Jack Frost's Playground</color>.
This fearsome creature surrounds itself with a protective cloud of poisonous gas, and must be approached with the utmost caution.
I think you'll find this is no time for jokes.<NL>Come back when you're ready to treat my research with the respect it deserves.
Ah, it's you.<NL>Are you ready to take my research seriously?
The subjects of my current study are beasts so ferocious that they cannot be caught.
And due to the impossibility of capture, they can only be studied once they have been subdued in combat.
Now, do you want to help the progress of science or not? The answer is "yes," by the way...
The next research subject is the <color:#1>auric collum</color>, which nests atop the <color:#1>Genie's Steps</color> to the southeast of the <color:#1>Shimmering Sands</color>.
If my sources are to be believed, the body of this mysterious creature glows with a majestic golden hue.
The last creature I require you to hunt is the <color:#1>shellmet</color>. I think you'll find it on the island of <color:#1>No Longer Mine, to the south of Autumnia</color>.
Its sharp spike and highly durable shell make it one of the deadliest creatures known to science.
Your help in advancing the cause of science has not gone unnoticed, you know.
I think we'll find the ultimate secrets of the animal kingdom sooner than expected thanks to you.
Oh, it's you. I think you'll find my next piece of research most stimulating...
I say, dear boy, by the cut of your jib, I'd hazard a guess at your being a traveling man, what? And a jolly fine occupation it is, too!
Are you...a traveler too, Sir?
Very shrewd, dear boy! I am indeed! Inherited a pretty pile from my maiden aunt, and decided to travel the world, dontcha know?
Blimey, it's all right for some, eh? Spare a guilder for a struggling fairy aristocrat, there's a gent!
Haw haw haw! Very droll, dear boy, very droll!<NL>But I'm not just pootling around handing out alms to the poor, you know.
I'm writing my memoirs, you see. A sort of travel diary, you know the kind of thing. You really should read it, it's corking stuff...
Here, it's just...ah... Oh, I say!
It must be... Dash it all!
It's not here!<NL>It's bally well up and grown legs!
You've lost your diary?
Yes, I rather think I have. I must have left it somewhere, damned fool that I am...
Oh, this really is the absolute limit!<NL>My literary legacy, gone! All gone!
There's tragic, pooer bloke.<NL>D'you reckon we should offer to help?
Don't worry, Mister!<NL>We'll help you find it!
You will?<NL>Oh, I say, that really is awfully good of you.
En't it just.<NL>So where'd you last see it then, eh?
Well now, let me see... I rather think it might have been when I sat down beside <color:#1>the river northwest of here</color> to compose a little vignette.
The water of that babbling brook was poetry itself, so I plopped myself down on a <color:#1>little island in the stream</color> and set to work...
So you think that's where you might have left it, huh?
It's certainly a possibility. Lovely little spot it was... Small island, <color:#1>couple of trees</color>, jolly pretty...
Got it! Okay, we'll go look for it for you.
You're a saint, dear boy!<NL>A veritable saint!
My gift to literature... Gone forever!
You're a traveling man, eh, dear boy?<NL>Takes one to know one, what?
I'm writing my memoirs, dontcha know.<NL>A sort of travel diary, you know the kind of thing.<NL>You really should read it, it's corking stuff...
Here, it's just...ah... Oh, I say!<NL>It must be... Dash it all!
Is something wrong?
Yes, I rather think it is. I must have dropped my bally diary somewhere, damned fool that I am...
I say, you wouldn't be so good as to help me look for the silly old thing, would you?
I rather think I might have misplaced it when I sat down <color:#1>on an island in the river northwest of here</color> to compose a little vignette.
Lovely little spot it was... Small island, <color:#1>couple of trees</color>, jolly pretty...
You really must help me out, dear boy!<NL>The loss to literature would be too tragic for words!
Here you go, Sir. Is this your diary?
Oh, I say!<NL>It bally well is, yes! Capital!<NL>You really are a lifesaver, dear boy!
That's okay. I'm just glad it turned out to be where you said it was. I sure hope you don't lose it again.
Oh, I most certainly shan't! Certainly not!<NL>I'd say you deserve a reward for coming to the aid of the party, what? Here!
Thanks again, old thing.<NL>Now I can continue on my travels! Toodle-oo!
I'm traveling the world, dontcha know!<NL>A gentleman of leisure, pootling from place to place, and whiling the merry days away!
Oh, it's you! Hello, Mister!
...Hm? Oh, why...hello there, dear boy!
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
Eh? Oh, not at all, old thing. I was just exercising the old thinking muscle. I rather supect my travels might be at an end, dontcha know.
Really? So you're going to finish up your diary and head on home, huh?
That's about the size of it, yes. I made a jolly exciting discovery that I think might top off my story rather nicely.
What kind of discovery?
What kind indeed, old stick! You see, I came across a large and rather ruined-looking door on the far edge of a forest.
I wrote the details down for posterity, of course. Let me just grab the old diary—
...Oh, I say!
I could have sworn it was...
Oh, blast and botheration!
For goodness' flipping—<NL>No need to explain—we know the drill.<NL>Shall we, Ollie-boy?
Leave it to us, Mister!<NL>We'll find it for you!
You really are a brick, old thing!<NL>A dyed-in-the-wool, true-blue brick!
So if you wrote the details down in your diary, you must remember where you last had it, huh?
Well, now that you mention it, I suppose I must...<NL>Yes, it must have been by the door itself.
There's simple! Righto, just tell us where this ruined door is, and we'll be off!
Well, now, let me see... Yes...
I went for a stroll in the countryside, dontcha know. <color:#1>Made a beeline south from town</color>, and ended up in a forest that was very deep indeed...
I wandered on, deeper and deeper, and...
You came to a big, ruined door, right?
Yes, I did rather. Stopped and scribbled a passage or two right in front of it. When the Muse is willing, and all that! Do you know—it might very well be there!
Righto! Can't think of where that might be exactly, but we'll go and have a look for you. We're nice like that, see?
But you're my only hope, dear boy!<NL>Without you, I'm bally well scuppered!
Oh, hello, dear boy! Why, I haven't seen you since...oh, it must be Castaway Cove, what?
Well, I've news for you—I'm finally packing the traveling lark in and heading homeward!
I made rather a splendid discovery that should top off my story nicely, so I'm calling it a day.
...Oh, I say! I could have sworn it was...<NL>Oh, blast and botheration!
I wandered on, deeper and deeper, and ended up by a <color:#1>rather large ruined door</color>. That's where I left it, I'll bet my bally arm!
We found your diary, Sir...again!
Jolly good show, old thing! Now I can retire to the old homestead and commit the tale of my travels to posterity at last!
Just don't go losing the flipping thing before you get home, all right? That's the last time we go traipsing after it! I mean it this time!
And good luck writing your book, Sir!<NL>I'm sure it will be just swell!
As am I, dear boy, as am I!<NL>Ah, I almost forgot—your hard-earned reward!<NL>You really are the brickiest of bricks, what?
By George, I almost forgot! I picked up a rather intriguing artifact on my travels...
Yes, it's in here somewhere...
Aha! Here we go...<NL>It seems to be a list of recipes.<NL>Not my area, but I'd say they look rather good...
They sure oughta—they're alchemy formulae!<NL>I'll copy them down, if that's okay with you.<NL>Thank you very much!
Righty-ho! Time to take up the mantle of the old<NL>scribe, what?
I rather think it's time I brought my travels to an end...
You learned some new alchemy formulae!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
Looks like we've patched up the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
We'd best let him know, en't it?
Looks like we've patched up all the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
That'll be the end of it then, I s'pose.<NL>We'd best let him know, en't it?
Welcome to one of the Cat's Cradle chain of purremium inns! We purride ourselves on our purracticality and purricing!
Your custom is always apurreciated!<NL>Have a nice nap!
Your custom is always apurreciated!<NL>Mmmyoh, you look a little...unusual.<NL>You're a traveler, I purresume?
Then I encourage you to take a nap at each of our inns, wherever your travels may take you!
We're very purroud of our deep and comfortable beds, and we hope you enjoy them as much as we do!
...Eh? Look at youer Wizard's Companion—there's something different about it...
Ah! There's useful! The memories of all the travelers who've stayed here have filled it back up a bit!
Gee, I never expected that...
Why the heck not, mun? It's a flipping mighty spellbook, en't it? We'd best stay at as many of these places as we can, eh?
I guess so, huh?
I trust you had another purrfect night's sleep at the Cat's Cradle? Travel safely now!
And remember...<NL>Your next nap need never be far away!
Welcome to Swift Solutions, where those in need come to watch their worries fly away!

Hm? Hoo's there? Oh, hello.<NL>Hoo can I help you today?
Owl be seeing you soon!
Caw! A customer! I don't mean to crow, but our wares are the finest in the land!
With these prices, we must be raven mad!<NL>Come again soon!
Do you really expect to be allowed into the palace looking like that? Strangely dressed foreigners are not permitted!
Apologies, but everyone in the palace is busy trying to find the King's <color:#1>red herring</color>.
Oi, hadn't we better give this here <color:#1>red herring</color> to that guard from before?
That's the old well down that way, mun.<NL>Terrible damp, it is—and youer enough of a wet blanket as it is! Ha!
Have you visited the Grave of the Sage?<NL>It's off to the east of the palace entrance.
People say they've heard voices coming from that big gravestone thing, but I don't believe them. There's no such thing as ghosts...is there?
To the Deep Dark Wood!
This way, mun! This way!
You lost or something?<NL>Can't see youer way for the tears, is it?
Oi, where d'you think youer going?<NL>You scared or something?
Let's help that guard out, shall we?
That guard's not exactly short of get-up-and-go, is he? I can smell the enthusiasm on him from here!
Squatting like that can lead to only one thing: pooer circulation! There's painful!
So near, yet so far, eh? There's frustrating!
Righto! Let's do this, and do it proper!
Not Take Heart, mun! Give Heart!<NL>The other flipping one!
This is where you come in, Ollie-boy!
Take a look in them sparkly pots, mun!<NL>You never know what you'll find!
Why not take a look round town, mun?<NL>Might find something useful, en't it?
I can see why you'd want to nose around and that, but shouldn't we visit the palace first?
Youer clothes are just a bit too futuristic for these parts! No vision, these people!
Why not have a quick chat with some of the folks around town? Lovely, they are!
You can see the shops and all that on youer map. But you knew that, right?
Where was that Swift Solutions place again?
You've got a proper good memory on you, eh?
What were those stamp card things, again...?
They've got fairy-sized beds too, haven't they?
Don't forget to check the Errand Board over at Swift Solutions good and often, will you?
Get a good night's sleep, and youer new outfit will be ready in the morning! Tidy!
These merit stamp card thingies are proper good, eh? I fancy getting that Jumping Jack award. What about you? Got youer eye on any?
Youer off to meet a king, Ollie-boy.<NL>Best dress for the occasion, en't it?
You do know where youer going, don't you?<NL>...Don't you?
There's marvelous! Suit you lovely, they do!<NL>I thought you'd look much sillier than that...
Oi, shall we go and see the King, or what?
Youer cape's proper snazzy, eh? A bit too snazzy for my liking. I might have to get one of my own...
A red herring, eh?<NL>I hope it's not flipping massive or anything...
D'you reckon you can eat these red herring thingies?
Didn't we see a pond close to one of the shops somewhere?
The secret to jumping is to be light on youer feet, and to think froglike. Froglike, got it?
Eh? You want me to do it? No way, mun!
Don't look at me like that, mun!<NL>I'm not flipping doing it!
It flipping got away!<NL>You've got to be more light on youer feet, mun!
Let's go and have a look over by the palace, shall we?
He's a slippery beggar, eh? Is it because he's red? Oh, hang on, that makes no flipping sense, does it?
Are you going to stand around chin-wagging, or are we going to get a flipping move on, hm?
If we don't deliver him soon, he'll go all floppy!<NL>Well, more floppy... You know what I mean.
Why do I have to carry this flipping flopping thing, anyway?
If you squat down, I'll be able to understand you much better, you know...
The King himself is brokenhearted!<NL>Who'd have thunk it, eh?
Keep an eye on the Locket, mun!<NL>You know what it means if it starts glowing!<NL>...You better flipping had do, anyway!
That much enthusiasm, and him only a youngster! There's amazing!
Let's get a move on and talk to that young 'un, shall we?
Wearing a pot on his head? Well, if the soldiering doesn't work out, the boy's got a future in comedy, at least!
That's some serious get-up-and-go, that is!<NL>We can't let that go to waste!
Let's go and give the King his missing piece of heart back, shall we?
What's all this about monster mice, eh?<NL>Ding Dong Dell's really gone downhill, mun...
You know youer familiars can use equipment, don't you? Go and ask beaky down at the Cawtermaster's Store if you want to know more.
Let's go and see the Cawtermaster, shall we?
We cured King Tom, didn't we?<NL>This should be a piece of cake, mun!
I hope we can find ouerselves a wand now.<NL>Stuffed if I know what we'll do if we can't...
That King Tom must have a proper tidy wand.<NL>He's a king, en't it?
Let's save up ouer pennies and come back for another visit, shall we?
We've got to go over to youer world to find out what's wrong over by here!
We're not going to find Timmy round by here, are we, now?
Come on, mun!<NL>Timmy en't round by here, is he now?
Where do you think youer going, hm?<NL>What about old Timmy-boy?
First a cat, and now a mouse, eh?
Now you mention it, that Tommy Stout said something, didn't he? What was it again?
If it's mice we're after, we should be looking somewhere proper dark and dingy, eh?
Those thumbelemurs can do that "Psyche Up" thingy, en't it? You use that first, then you let 'em "Go Wild"! Proper powerful, it is!
You don't want to buy any supplies or nothing before heading down that well? You sure now?
He's a proper good 'un, that one, eh?<NL>Even had his own familiar! There's marvelous!
Now we've got that spell, we can open chests and stuff that we couldn't open before, en't it?
If you Psyche Up one of youer familiars, then use "Go Wild," you can do one-and-a-half times the damage, and maybe even stop baddies' spells! Tidy!
What's that new spell we've got? Spring Lock?<NL>Ooh, just think of all the things we can unlock now... The mind boggles, it does...
What's the matter with you, eh?<NL>Shouldn't you be looking for the King?
Southward we go, to Golden Grove!
After Golden Grove, it's on to Al Mamoon!
Oi! En't you s'posed to be restoring the Spring of Life to its former glory?
En't we s'posed to be going and meeting that Rashaad bloke?
Come on, Ollie-boy!<NL>Let's get over to youer world!
Get a move on!<NL>We've got to help Rusty, en't it!?
En't you got something you need to tell Myrtle?
Let's get ouer bottoms in gear and get back to Al Mamoon, shall we?
Are you sure the Temple of Trials is this way?
And youer sure this is the way to the Temple of Trials, are you?
What's wrong with you, mun? We need to go and see the Supreme Sage, en't it?
We're going nowhere fast until we pass those Trials, mun.
Come on, mun! Let's get down to the Temple and take that third Trial!
The Supreme Sage is waiting for us, en't he?
I know Solomon said to take a break, but that's no reason to go running off flipping miles away now, is it, mun?
We're s'posed to be heading for Al Mamoon, en't it?
We'll never stop that volcano from erupting if we don't get a flipping move on!
Reckon we've got a thing or two to be going and telling Rashaad, don't you?
Onward, to Castaway Cove!
We need to get after that dirty rotten thief, en't it?
Just going to let that stinking thief run off with the pot, are we?
Oi! Where are you off to, eh? The magic words for that pot are in the flipping Wizard's Companion, mun!
Come on, mun! Let's get down to Castaway Cove and set sail on the high seas!
We need to get that Cowlipha of Al Mamoon to let us borrow her boat, en't it?
Fancy taking a look at the Cat's Cradle they've got over in Al Mamoon? I hear it's a proper snazzy one.
Let's get over to youer world, shall we?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, en't there?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, mun!
Shift it, mun! Let's get back to Al Mamoon!
We need to head over to Al Mamoon and find us some restraint, mun!
Don't you like Al Mamoon or something?<NL>We need to head back there, mun!
Let's go and give old Cowface her restraint back, shall we?
If we head down to Castaway Cove, we should be able to ride that boat now, en't it?
Oi! We need to get back to Castaway Cove and retrieve ouer stolen goods!
Come on, mun! We need to go down to Castaway Cove and find us some restraint!
Let's go and hand over that restraint we got ouerselves, shall we?
That boat's going to leave without us if we don't get a flipping move on! Castaway Cove, and don't spare the ulks!
All aboard!<NL>Let's go and hit the high seas, en't it!
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
...Eh? Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.

Let's hurry up and get ouerselves to Hamelin, shall we?
D'you see any sages round by here?<NL>I flipping don't!
Reckon youer going to get some Hamelin armor round by here, do you? Well I flipping don't!
Oi, what do you think youer doing, ditching youer piggy armor and running off?
What exactly does this have to do with sneaking ouer way into the palace in Hamelin, hm?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?

The three kingdoms, all working together.<NL>Never thought I'd see the day, mun...
Next up, King Tom!<NL>The cat for the cut!
You really think it was stolen, do you?<NL>Sure you didn't drop it somewhere?
I mean, it's a flipping great log, mun.<NL>How did you not notice something like that going missing?
We'd better retrace ouer steps, eh?
Flipping mice again! And this time, it's some speccy one, not that Hickory Dock... I hate flipping mice!

Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?

So, off back to youer world, is it...?<NL>...C-Can't be helped I s'pose, eh?<NL>Sorry, got something in my eye...
Well, well... Only seems like two minutes ago that you first got here, and now youer off home.<NL>Time flies when youer having fun, eh? (sniff)
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
Ding Dong Dell's safe, mun! It's Al Mamoon and Hamelin we need to worry about now!
There's nothing to worry about with Pea on ouer side, eh? She's pretty flipping powerful for a littlie!
Going up against King Tom himself!<NL>Who'd have thunk it, eh?
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
I wonder how things are over in the palace, eh?
If we can smash that black crystal thingy, everyone should go back to normal, en't it?
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
Ahh, what a lovely breeze. There's soothing...<NL>Fancy a quick nap? I know I do...
Don't get lost now, mun!<NL>I'm rubbish at directions!
Ahh, there's nothing like a good castle to make you feel like youer on an adventure, eh? Tidy!
There's no shortage of fishies round by here, eh? D'you reckon they taste all right? I might give one a try...
Look at those clouds, mun! Like big fluffy loaves of bread, they are! Gah, I've gone and made myself hungry now...
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
You should have a read of youer Wizard's Companion once in a while, mun. It's the wizardly thing to do.
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
You talking to me or chewing a brick? Sorry, mun. Just wanted to try and sound tough. Pretty convincing, eh?
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...

...! .........!!!<NL>.........?
Nice to see you again!<NL>Did you have fun crossing the desert?
Fun!? It was flipping boiling, mun!
Boiling for you, maybe, pip-squeak.<NL>I'm a ghost, and ghosts don't feel the heat.<NL>So there!
What are you doing here, Horace?
I'm looking at these fountains. They're amazing. They squirt out milk! All the milk a boy could drink! They're what Al Mamoon is famous for.
But the spicy smell coming from that food stall is mixing with the smell of the milk. It's...strange.
Ha! You think so? I kinda like it!
Hey, there are still loads of spells you don't know yet, aren't there, Oliver?
Well, I am trying... It's just that my Wizard's Companion is kinda... Uh, most of the pages are missing.
Missing? Oh yeah, I had to give you the page for<NL><color:#8>Spirit Medium</color>, didn't I?
Uh-huh. When Mr. Drippy first gave it to me, the only spell inside was <color:#8>Gateway</color>.
Really? So the pages had been torn out?<NL>I bet it was that idiot Shadar's doing...
All right, I suppose I'd better help you fill it back up again, hadn't I?
Tidy! There's generous. Maybe I was wrong about you being a stingy little midget, after all...
Well, I'm not just going to hand a load of pages over, if that's what you're thinking. Oliver will have to prove his wizarding comprehension skills first.
The Wizard's Companion isn't just full of spells. There are also stories in there that were gathered by the sages over the centuries.
But those have probably been torn out, too. Stories are pretty powerful, after all. They might inspire people to stand up to him...
Right! I'm going to give you one to get you started.<NL>Have a read. It's one of my favorites.
Did you read the story I gave you? Well, I hope you read it carefully, because I've got a question for you! Ready?
Good. Here goes...
There are quite a few characters in the story.<NL>Can you remember them all?
Tell me, who was the <color:#1>third smallest</color> out of the prince, the lion king, the dragon of the east, and the dragon of the west? It was the...?
What? You haven't read it yet? Hurry up, lazybones!<NL>It's the first story of the Twelve Tales of Wonder in your Wizard's Companion!
You don't know the answer?<NL>Read it again and come back.
Correct!<NL>Very impressive!
Your wizardly comprehension must be almost as good as mine! Oh, I said I'd help you fill your Wizard's Companion back up, didn't I? Here.
Thanks, Horace!
I suppose it was a bit mean giving you a question like that, but you worked it out eventually.
And that's what being a wizard is all about: learning to look carefully at every detail and understand what's<NL>going on.
Shut up with the wise old man talk, will you?<NL>Youer no flipping older than Ollie-boy here!
I'm not? No, I don't suppose I am...<NL>At least I don't seem to be...
What's that s'posed to mean?
It's strange... I feel like I'm forgetting something...<NL>Something really, really important...
...Never mind. I can't believe how much this place has changed. I'm going to see if other towns around the world are as different these days.
I think I'll head somewhere with a bracing sea breeze next. I might not be able to feel the wind on my face,<NL>but I can still enjoy the view...
See you soon!
I'm going to head somewhere with a bracing sea breeze next. I seem to remember there was a place like that on the far side of the desert...
Do not worry about my beloved princess.<NL>I will take the utmost care of her from now on.
Ha ha ha! My beloved princess is utterly devoted to the delicious babana!
I myself prefer the invigorating spices of the fiery curries of Al Mamoon.
Greetings, friends! Here in Al Mamoon, the tale of my beloved princess and I is often told.
But whenever she hears it, my darling cannot help but boast that she knows of another chapter. I fear that people may begin to suspect something...
Beloved Princess!<NL>I will protect you from this day until my last!
Did you see it? The white ash that fell from the skies, and...the savage beasts it created...
My beloved princess and I were not transformed. Could this be because of our former curse?
The city seems...agitated of late.<NL>Almost as if it were preparing for war...
If war is indeed upon the horizon, then I must fight. I must protect my beloved princess.
I pray every day for your safety on the perilous road that you tread...
I was recently introduced to the delights of the babana!
I never dreamed such a succulent and delicious fruit could exist! Truly, this is an age of miracles!
We had the incomparable honor of meeting the Cowlipha! She is a great presence, and a most generous ruler.
She allows the people of the town to drink freely of the milk produced by the fountains in the square. Such magnanimity!
Why...? Why has this happened...? What did the people of Al Mamoon do to deserve such a cruel fate?
Friends! I am so relieved to see you safe and well!<NL>You are not injured, I hope?
The town was bathed in a great light, and the people were returned to their former selves. Whatever could have been the cause?
I feel it lurking beyond the clouds... A sinister power... A power that does not belong in this age...
It is a power akin to that of the black-hearted cobra lord who returned to torment us... Might the two be related, do you think?
People of the world—come, spice up your lives!
(sigh) Ohhh, I am so weary...<NL>Where is the fire I once had...?
Are you sick, Sir?
Sick? It is worse than mere sickness, boy! Much worse. I have grown tired of the mixing of spices. And the mixing of spices is my life.
Oi oi! This must be that Sheikh of Spice we heard about, en't it?
It must be, huh?
But there's something up with the old feller.<NL>We'd best find out what it is, eh?
We should, huh. Uh, how come you don't want to mix spices anymore, Sir?
You ask why? There is no "why."<NL>There is only emptiness...
But you're known all over for your spice mixing,<NL>Mr. Sheikh!
Don't you have customers who rely on you?
Perhaps I do... But I cannot bring myself to do what they ask of me. I can barely bring myself to rise each morning...
Jeepers... We were kinda hoping you might mix some spices for us, but it seems like you're in a real bad way.
I wish only to rest.<NL>Please, bother someone else.
B-But—
Save youer breath, Ollie-boy.<NL>The old codger's brokenhearted, en't it.
He is?
He is. Drained of every last drop of <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, unless I'm very much mistaken.
We have to help him, Mr. Drippy!
That we do, Ollie-boy, that we do! Let's find the Sheikh the va-va-voom he needs to spice up his life!
Ooh, there's cold, you are. What kind of wizard leaves an old man in the lurch like that?
Ohh, I am so very weary...<NL>I cannot bring myself to work...
Uh, excuse me... We were wondering if you could maybe mix some spices for us...
(sigh) I wish only to rest.<NL>Please, find another tired old man to bother.
Do you think he might be brokenhearted, Mr. Drippy?
That I do, Ollie-boy. And it's <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> he's lacking, although I'm sure you spotted that for youerself.
You got some <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> there, en't it? Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over!
By the beards of the Ancients! What is this strange sensation!? I feel...alive!
And I wish to mix spices with more urgency than ever before in my long life!
Neato! We did it, Mr. Drippy!
That's some tidy work, Ollie-boy!
I do not understand... Is this thanks to you?
Then I am in your debt. I must reward you.<NL>Here, please accept this.
And if you have any spice-related requests, I would be most honored to hear them. I wish only to work my<NL>mixing magic!
As a matter of fact, we do! Could you mix us some of your special spices?
M-My special spices!?<NL>Where did you hear talk of such things?
Keep youer hair on! Matey who runs that curry stall asked us, en't it. He needs ingredients for his tikka mahala.
...Very well. If that is all you require them for, I will be glad to oblige you.
But I do not have all of the ingredients required.<NL>You must bring me those I am lacking.
Sure. What do you need, Mr. Sheikh?
For such a potent mixture, I will require <color:#1>a turmeric root</color> and <color:#1>three generous pinches of spicy seeds</color>.
Yes, Sir! Thank you so much for agreeing to help us!
Think nothing of it, boy. It is my pleasure. Return to me when you have the ingredients I require.
(sigh) Even to breathe is an effort worthy of the Ancients...
To work!<NL>The spices will not mix themselves!
Must I tell you again? To create my special spices, I will require <color:#1>a turmeric root</color> and <color:#1>three generous pinches of spicy seeds</color>.
The turmeric root can be obtained from a beast known as the <color:#1>lumberwood</color>.
The Ancients smile upon you, boy, for this ferocious foe has but recently appeared mere leagues from here! Visit Swift Solutions to learn more.
<color:#1>Spicy seeds</color> can be obtained only from the hottest of soils—perhaps those of a great volcano.
By the Ancients! You have gathered the ingredients I asked of you! To mix them is the work of mere moments for a master such as myself!
It is done. You have the honor of possessing a quantity of the <color:#1>Sheikh's most coveted special spices</color>! In the right hands, they will produce a curry beyond compare!
Perhaps I will ask young Raj to prepare a tikka mahala<NL>for myself...
My friend has most kindly lent me a magnificent picture book! I cannot wait to return home and read it!
No! You cannot have it back!<NL>I have not finished with it!
Wh-What is wrong with you?<NL>Yesterday you told me you would return it!
Hey, you two! Stop fighting!<NL>What's the problem here?
The problem is that this thief will not return to me the picture book I lent him!
It is only a picture book—and a poor one at that!<NL>Who cares?
I care!
It was a birthday gift!<NL>You must give it back!
Ach! Stop bothering me and go away!
Crikey, either he's had his heart broken and every ounce of <color:#1>kindness</color> squeezed out of it, or he needs putting over someone's knee!
You think he's brokenhearted?<NL>But he seems so...lively.
Well, it depends on which bit of heart's been stolen, en't it. Changes youer personality in all different ways, it does.
Anyway, what are we going to do about it, more importantly? Are we going to help the other lad get his book back?
We sure are!<NL>I'd hate for them not to be friends anymore!
Righto. Then we need to find ouerselves a drop of good old-fashioned <color:#1>kindness</color>, en't it?
No? Really? And you reckon these two'll be all right if we don't help them, do you? Fair enough...
Give my picture book back to me!<NL>Yesterday you told me you would return it!
No! It is only a picture book—and a poor one at that!<NL>Who cares?
You can't just keep the things other people lend you,<NL>you know.
You got some <color:#1>kindness</color> there, en't it? Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over!
Hm...? What... What happened? I intended to return the picture book, but then I...
Truly? You meant to return it?
But of course. I will go and fetch it now.<NL>Forgive me for my selfishness!
Thank you so very much for helping me return to normal! Please, you must accept this!
The picture book you lent me was most splendid!<NL>Thank you, friend!
My father sails all over the world aboard the merchant ships of Castaway Cove. He tells me that the export of babanas is a most profitable trade.
My friend has become very...strange.<NL>I wonder what can have happened to him...
The picture book was a birthday gift.<NL>I cannot believe he would be so cruel...
You truly think so?<NL>It is my favorite story also!
Al Mamoon is a town rich with commerce, and alive with the cries of merchants. I myself sell ice creams made from delicious, creamy milk.
My fine ices are known throughout this fair city.<NL>You must try one when next you visit!
Ohhh, I am so very afraid...<NL>I cannot bring myself to go...
Is something wrong, Mister?<NL>You seem a little...unhappy.
I am indeed, boy.<NL>Will you hear my tale of woe?
Uh, sure.
Thank you! You are a kindhearted child! You see, I am the purveyor of Al Mamoon's finest milk ice creams.
I have been preparing to set off on a journey to research a means of making my wares yet more refreshing and delicious.
You have?<NL>Where are you headed?
A village in a realm of ice, far off beyond the horizon.
The people of this village are versed in all the ways of ice, and I hope to learn from them how to improve my wares yet further.
That's amazing! It takes a whole lot of guts to go out into the big, wide world! Good luck!
Y-You do not understand... I cannot go any longer. Though I have invested much time and effort in my preparations...
What!? Why the flip not?<NL>I thought you said you'd made youer mind up to go?
I have been assailed by an insurmountable terror. The talk of savage beasts roaming the land fills me with dread. I cannot bring myself to depart.
What has happened to me? I who was once so brave, and so driven to take the next step in ice cream advancement...
This doesn't seem like your average change of heart, huh, Mr. Drippy? Do you think he's...?
Brokenhearted? I reckon he might be, Ollie-boy.<NL>Lacking in <color:#1>courage</color>, if I'm not mistaken.
And without it, he's never going to up his ice-cream game. There's tragic!
We can't leave him like this!<NL>We have to find him some <color:#1>courage</color>!
Tidy! Let's get to it then, shall we?
Really? Youer just going to leave him in this lily-livered mess, are you...?
I am so filled with terror that I am unable to depart on my journey of discovery...
That doesn't sound like your average change of heart, huh, Mr. Drippy? Do you think he's...?
Here, you've got some <color:#1>courage</color>, en't it? Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over, why don't you?
...By the beards of the Ancients! I am filled with a most powerful boldness! I fear neither beast nor man!
I can endure any hardship if my efforts might further the advancement of ice cream!
Tidy! Looks like someone's back to his old self!
It sure does!<NL>You're all better now, huh, Mister?
Better? I am better than better!<NL>I must depart on my journey at once!
You have my thanks. This can express but a fraction of my gratitude, but please, you must accept it.
After all my preparations, I am alas unable to depart on my journey of discovery...
It is time! Time to depart on my journey of discovery! I must prepare!
Ahh, today, at long last, I will be reunited with my beloved! Every second feels like an hour!
Ohh, I just can't stop worrying...<NL>Have I lost her forever...?
What's wrong?<NL>You seem kinda upset...
It's my beloved. I just can't help thinking that she has given her heart to another...
Eh? Going behind youer back, you mean?<NL>Have you got proof, like?
No. I have no proof. She lives many leagues from here in my homeland. We meet only rarely.
Well, if you've got no proof, what are you doubting her for? That's not very nice, is it?
But she's so beautiful...her eyes are like the stars themselves... I just know that other suitors must be flocking to her door...
Ohhh! I'm so worried I can't think!
Gee, he's in a real bad way.<NL>If only he could learn to trust her...
That's exactly what he can't do, Ollie-boy. Brokenhearted, he is, see. Suffering for want of a little <color:#1>belief</color>.
We can't leave the pooer lad like this.<NL>We've got to help him out, en't it?
That's decided, then! Let's get this boy a bit of heart to bolster his <color:#1>belief</color> in his beloved!
Fair enough. It's sad to see him like that, but we're busy people, en't it? Maybe another time...
I just can't help thinking that my beloved has given her heart to another... Ohhh! I'm so worried I can't think!
Well, it doesn't take a doctor to tell that this fretful young fellow's suffering for want of a little <color:#1>belief</color>.
I guess I better cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand over that <color:#1>belief</color>, huh?
Hm? I don't feel worried any more! How could I have doubted my beloved? I've been a complete fool!
That you have, my lad, there's no denying it!<NL>Fretting like that won't get you nowhere!
You're right. Thanks to you, I have regained my faith in my dear, beautiful beloved!
I must give you something to say thank-you.<NL>Here. Will this do?
Ohhh, I can't wait to see my beloved again!<NL>Every second is like an hour!
Though I say it myself, I believe I may have created something of surpassing beauty...
Ach! It is wrong! It is all wrong! This picture is a disgrace! I have no talent!
What's wrong?
Oh...it is you. (sigh) I... I have lost faith in my ability as an artist. There, I have said it.
What are you on about, mun? This picture is an absolute banger! What's not to be proud of?
This daub? It is a scribble. A travesty. A monstrosity.<NL>I cannot even look at it.
It looks pretty good to me.<NL>Why don't you let your customers decide?
How can I, when it is so painfully apparent that I lack even the smallest grain of talent? It is time I put away my brushes for good...
Ahh, so that's it, is it? I see, I see. He's brokenhearted, en't it, Ollie-boy? Lost his <color:#1>confidence</color>, he has.
So you think we should help him out, huh?
All right! Let's help him!
Tidy. All you need to do is bring him some <color:#1>confidence</color>, and Bob's youer uncle.
I sure feel sorry for him, but we already have so much<NL>to do...
None would part with their hard-won guilders for a picture so tasteless, so...ugly. It seems I have no talent, after all...
I don't know...it looks pretty good to me.<NL>Why don't you let your customers decide?
I have no talent after all.<NL>It is time I put away my brushes for good...
Looks like youer ready to cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and restore ouer friend here's <color:#1>confidence</color>.
By the Ancients! Why was I gripped so with doubt? With fear that I was not the artist I always believed myself to be?
So...you don't think you're talentless anymore?
I most certainly do not! And it is all thanks to you!<NL>Give up painting? Ha! To think I ever considered it!
This is scant reward for granting me the strength to take up the brush once more, but please, you must accept it.
What will the subject of my next great work be, I wonder... Perhaps the breathtaking natural beauty of a verdant oasis...
Babanas are the greatest wonder of our world, do you not agree?
Ach, what have I done with my life?<NL>Perhaps my farming days are at an end...
But husband—what has become of you?<NL>You used to love your babanas so...
Excuse me, Ma'am, can I ask what seems to be<NL>the problem?
It is my husband. Suddenly, he tells me that he wishes to retire from his beloved babana growing.
He does? But why?
He says that the fruit that has been his life for so many years no longer interests him...
I have given my life to the babana.
But no longer. Those accursed fruits will dictate the pattern of my days no more.
But babana growing's all you know, en't it? And what will everyone do without you to supply them with lovely, tasty fresh fruit?
That is not a problem. I will simply entrust my farm to the care of another. One younger, who feels the passion<NL>I have lost.
It seems kinda weird that he would just stop loving babanas all of a sudden, huh, Mr. Drippy?<NL>Do you think he might be...?
Yeah, I reckon he might be, Ollie-boy. If you ask me, ouer friend here's lacking a bit of the old <color:#1>love</color>.
We should help him out, en't it?
Tidy! Where is the <color:#1>love</color>?<NL>You'd better find out!
Youer just going to leave him like this, are you?<NL>There's charitable. And what do you think will<NL>happen to all those lovely babanas, hm?
Perhaps my farming days are at an end...<NL>I have lost my passion for the babana...
You got some <color:#1>love</color> there, en't it?<NL>Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over!
What is this feeling...?<NL>I feel...better!
By the Ancients! I must return to the farm immediately! My beloved babanas will wither and die without my care and attention!
Neato! We healed him!<NL>Now he loves babanas more than ever!
It seems I do... Was this your doing, boy?
Then you deserve thanks.<NL>Here. Forgive me, it is a mere trifle.
I have no passion for babanas any longer...<NL>I must entrust my farm to one who does...
Make ready! We must return to the babana fields at once!
My husband is truly enamored of the humble babana. It is all he ever speaks or dreams of, morning, noon, and night...
It is almost...unnatural...
My poor husband is behaving very strangely.<NL>Whatever can have happened to him?
Whatever is the matter with my poor husband?<NL>He once loved the babana so...intensely...
Yes, husband! It is so good to see you alive with enthusiasm for your beloved fruit once more!
Lately, I feel the Ancients are smiling upon me! With practice, I can be among the greatest singers in the land! I feel it in my heart!
(sigh) I must leave the world of entertainment behind me. I cannot bring myself to practice anymore, let alone perform...
What are you saying!? Did we not promise one another only yesterday that we would not rest until we had achieved greatness together?
Uh-oh. Having a bit of a barney, is it? What's it all about? Lovers' tiff or something?
Mr. Drippy!
It is no lovers' argument.<NL>It is far, far worse.
My one and only darling dear has decided to end her career in the world of song!
Do not make such a fuss. I have changed my mind, that is all. I can make my way in the world without it. I do not need to sing.
Wh— But— You have talked of achieving fame as a singer since childhood! Did you not always tell me it was your greatest dream?
My dream? Yes... But that is all it was.<NL>What need have I for dreams?
Mr. Drippy, do you think she's...?
Yep. Brokenhearted, she is. Robbed of the power to dream—drained of her <color:#1>ambition</color>...
What shall we do, Ollie-boy?<NL>We going to help her, or what?
We can't leave her like this!<NL>We have to get her <color:#1>ambition</color> back!
I sure feel sorry for her, but we already have so much<NL>to do...
Hmm... Looks like this young lady's been robbed of<NL>her <color:#1>ambition</color>...
Don't worry, Miss, I'm going to cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and give you back your <color:#1>ambition</color>.
Wh-What is this sensation? It is as if a weight has been lifted from my soul! I must sing! I must sing, or my heart will burst!
Whatever was I thinking? How could I ever have<NL>considered giving up my greatest passion!<NL>I must practice harder than ever before!
Oh, praise be to the Ancients! You are yourself again my dearest darling! And it is all thanks to you, friends!
You have my undying gratitude!<NL>Here! This is for you!
I have changed my mind. I do not care to sing anymore.<NL>I can make my way in the world without it...
I must practice and practice until I am the greatest singer in the land! It is all that I have ever dreamed of!
Were you aware that Al Mamoon is the center of song, dance, and music in our beautiful world?
We, too, wish to become performers. We came here from our home far to the south to dedicate ourselves to our dream!
My darling dear! Did we not promise one another only yesterday that we would not rest until we had achieved greatness together?
Would you really discard your childhood dream so carelessly? I cannot comprehend it!
And I will practice with you, my darling dear! Together, we will become the greatest entertainers in the history of Al Mamoon!
Time to knuckle down and work hard! We need to make enough money to open our dream shop!
(sigh) It's no good. I just can't be bothered.<NL>Leave me alone.
What's happened to you? You were full of beans when we set out from Ding Dong Dell...
Is everything okay?
Well, we're traveling merchants, you see. But since we arrived in Al Mamoon, my husband has completely lost his will to sell.
And after we went to all the trouble of leaving Ding Dong Dell to travel the world and earn enough money to open our dream shop...
Who cares about the stupid shop? Selling things is such a lot of effort. Let's not bother anymore.
Well, this doesn't look too good, does it? I reckon ouer friend here must be feeling a bit under the weather.
Hmph! I can see you're going to be no use. I'll just have to work for the two of us then, won't I?
That or we could mend his broken heart. One hubby-sized helping of <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> should do it!
It should? Hmm...
...Yes. We have to cure him.<NL>We can't just leave people who need our help.
En't it, though? Let's get a wriggle on and find us some <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> then, shall we?
Can't be bothered to lend a helping hand, eh?<NL>Well, it's up to you, I s'pose...
Where's the fire you had when we set out from Ding Dong Dell? What's happened to you?
He looks kinda...funny.<NL>Do you think there's something wrong with him?
'Course there is, mun! He's brokenhearted, en't it? In need of a healthy injection of <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>, if I'm not mistaken!
He is? Hmm...
Hm? Where am I? What was I doing...? Oh, that's it!<NL>We need to make enough money to open our dream shop!<NL>Let's get to work!
Darling! You're back to your old self!<NL>Thank goodness!
Sorry, my darling! Did I worry you? I'm so, so sorry.<NL>I'm better now. Let's get to work, shall we?
Neato! We cured him!
Thank you so much for helping me out.<NL>You deserve an extra special free gift!
Hmph! Whatever is the matter with you?
I suppose I have no choice but to do all the work myself...
I have to say, I'm very impressed.<NL>You're quite the little miracle worker!
All right, let's sell, sell, sell!<NL>Roll up! Roll up!
We have fabric aplenty at prices to die for!<NL>Roll up, roll up! Everything must go!
Welcome, welcome, welcome! My, what a beautiful cape! But it is not quite this season's look for the Mamooni man about town, you know.
Why not update your outfit with some of our top quality fabrics at prices to suit every purse? Buy now, or regret<NL>it forever!
Neato! Look at that! It's beautiful!<NL>A new cape, huh...
Oi, Ollie-boy! We're not here on a flipping shopping trip! What do you think we are? Made of money!?
Oh! A fairy! And a very stylish little fellow you are, too!<NL>I have something here that would suit you down to the ground! Let's see now... Oh yes! Perfect!
You reckon? ...Yeah, I see what you mean.<NL>I'd look the business in that...
Mr. Drippy...
Uh, oh, um— Sorry, Ollie-boy. I got a bit carried away, en't it. You've got to hand it to her, the girl can sell...
Roll up! Roll up! Fine fabrics to put a smile on your face and a spring in your step!
Look! The Locket is glowing!
And I reckon I know why—this young lady's got more <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> than a schoolful of six-year-olds!
Uh, excuse me Ma'am, I have something to ask you...
What is it, young man? Are you interested in some of our fine fabrics? I can offer you an excellent price!
Uh, no, it's not that... I was wondering if you'd maybe let us borrow a little of your enthusiasm.
Oh, don't you just say the funniest things! My enthusiasm and my smile always come for free! Take as much as<NL>you like!
That sure is kind of you, Ma'am, but we only need a little.
My, what a strange feeling!<NL>Now I feel even more ready to sell, sell, sell!
Roll up! Roll up! Take a look at our fine fabrics! They are guaranteed to put an extra-wide smile on your face and a spritely spring in your step!
Boy, she's something else! Excuse me, Ma'am, do you think we could borrow a little of your <color:#1>enthusiasm</color>?
But of course you can!<NL>And you may have it free of charge!
Thank you very much, Ma'am.<NL>We'll just take a little if that's okay.
Fabulous fabrics at truly breathtaking prices!<NL>Roll up! Roll up!
It will soon be time for the greatest celebration of the year here in Al Mamoon—the Babana Bazaar!
It will soon be time for the Babana Bazaar.<NL>What shall I give them this year...?
You sure look excited, Sir.
But of course I am, young man! The Babana Bazaar approaches, and I will soon have the inestimable pleasure of buying gifts for my dear grandchildren!
Gee... How many grandchildren do you have?
Let me see now... If we include those living in other towns across the land, it must be...perhaps thirty?
Jeepers creepers! That many?<NL>That's an awful lot of presents.
That may be so, but for each, I am rewarded with the priceless smile of a child.
And their happiness is my happiness.<NL>May the Ancients watch over them!
Crikey, the man's a living saint! You don't see <color:#1>kindness</color> like that every century, let alone every day!
Uh, Sir, would you mind helping us out with something?<NL>It could save people in trouble.
It could?
It sure could!<NL>Please, say you'll help us!
Very well, very well.<NL>Since you ask so nicely.
Thank you very much, Sir!
Oh-ho! What a marvelous sensation!<NL>My heart—my very soul—overflows with warmth!
Soon I must purchase presents for my beloved grandchildren! Oh, I look forward so to seeing their smiles of gratitude!
There's generous of him. You don't see <color:#1>kindness</color> like that every day.
It could? Then how can I possibly refuse?
Ahh, I look forward so to purchasing gifts for my grandchildren! Each one is as precious to me as all the jewels of the world!
By the beards of the Ancients! We punished them so severely last time, and yet they are back once more to sow unrest in the fields!
What's the matter, Ma'am?
It is terrible! Wild creatures of a most mischievous nature are running amok in our precious babana fields.
If this continues, I will have no choice but to spend my nights patrolling the very fields I work throughout the day.
Jeepers, that doesn't sound good!<NL>Are these creatures dangerous?
Dangerous!? They would pluck and eat my very livelihood from the trees! I have no choice but to drive them from my land!
Boy, she sure is brave!
En't it, though. It's not every woman her age goes out fighting monsters of an evening. I tell you what she's got in spades, Ollie-boy...
<color:#1>Courage</color>! She's the bravest lady I ever met!
Say, would you mind if we borrowed a little of your bravery to help people in need, Ma'am?
People in need, you say? To see a child as young as yourself striving to do good in the world is a fine thing indeed! Borrow from me what you will!
Thank you very much, Ma'am!
How odd... My heart feels...light, yet...warm.<NL>It is a strange feeling, but not unpleasant.<NL>Is that all you need of me? Very well.
I will not allow those evil creatures to ruin my livelihood and lay waste to my beautiful babana fields! I will destroy them!
A woman her age fighting monsters? Blimey, she must have <color:#1>courage</color> coming out of her flipping ears, mun!
Thank you very much, Ma'am!<NL>Just hold still for one second...
Soon I must go out on patrol!<NL>Our precious fields must not be left unprotected!
It is getting late...<NL>Where can he be...?
Nnngh...<NL>Perhaps I overdid it this time...
Are you hurt, Mister?
I am fine, boy. Do not worry about me.<NL>Now, I must return to my work...
What? You're going back to work even though you're injured? You can't!
Do not try to stop me.<NL>The beast must be defeated.
Eh? What beast?<NL>What are you on about, mun?
I speak of a hideous creature of gigantic proportions that has settled at the foot of the volcano to the west of here.
It has already gravely injured a member of my squad.<NL>I cannot allow it to inflict further misery.
It must be driven from the land at all costs!
That's why youer so worked up, is it?<NL>Fair enough...
I can't believe you'd go back and try to fight it with an injury like that. It's so dangerous! Aren't you scared?
Hm. I have lived many years, boy, but fear has yet to trouble me.
Crikey... Listen—youer <color:#1>courage</color> is very impressive and everything, but you need to rest up for a bit.
There is no time to rest!<NL>If the beast is not defeated soon, then—
Oh, for flip's sake! Fine! Go and get youerself bashed up even more! Ollie-boy, cast <color:#8>Take Heart</color> before he runs off to get walloped, will you?
Huh? Oh, sure!
Hmm... What is this? I feel...calmed.
Perhaps I have overstretched myself...<NL>I cannot face this foe alone...
Yes. I must ask Swift Solutions to locate a bounty hunter worthy of the task.
The infernal titan may be a mighty foe, but injured or not, I will drive him out! He will harm my people no more.
Well, he's not lacking for <color:#1>courage</color>, this one.<NL>But you need to give it a rest, pal, or youer going to get youerself proper done in.
Welcome to Al Mamoon, jewel of the desert!
Your journey across the sands must have been a tiring one. Please, make yourselves at home in our fair city.
Ach, it is hot...so fiercely hot...
Jeepers! You sure are sweating an awful lot, Mister.
Indeed. No matter how long I live, I will never grow accustomed to this infernal heat.
It must be real hard on you standing guard all day like that.
It is, of course. There are many who cannot endure the hardships of our profession.
Did you never think of quitting?
Ha ha! Never! I am proud to serve my country, and protect the peace of our great realm!
Ollie-boy! No ordinary person could stand there in the sun like that and not go babanas.
You're right. He must have a ton of <color:#1>restraint</color>, huh?
Uh, I hope you don't mind, but...I have something to<NL>ask you.
Of course. Is something the matter?
Well, there are people out there who have lost their restraint, and I was hoping we might borrow some of yours to help them out.
Your words mystify me. But if I can be of help to those in need, I will gladly assist you.
Thank you so much, Sir!
This sensation...it is...intriguing...<NL>And I feel...cooler. Incredible...
I am proud to serve my country, and protect the peace of our great realm! I would endure any amount of ferocious sunshine for the glory of Al Mamoon!
Flipping heck, he's sweating like a drain, mun!<NL>He must have some serious <color:#1>restraint</color> to be able to stand there like that. Oi, Ollie-boy, grab some, en't it!
Sure. Excuse me, Sir. There are people out there who have lost their restraint, and I was hoping we might borrow some of yours to help them out...
I must continue to stand guard over the glorious realm of Al Mamoon, and to keep the peace of our beloved kingdom!
This will be my next big seller, I am sure of it.<NL>Yes, I must stock up on these...
Whatever do you mean, husband!? Do you not remember the last time? I will not be left with box upon box of unsold items again!
Come on now, you two! Let's not wash ouer dirty laundry in public, shall we?
M-Mr. Drippy! Stop that!
No, boy. Your little friend is right.<NL>We must not bicker so here in the street.
It is my fool husband's fault...
Uh, no...Ma'am...please. It's, uh... It's okay.<NL>What's the problem, anyway?
My idiot husband is forever purchasing enormous quantities of his so-called "next big sellers."
And each time he does so, the accursed trinkets fail to sell in even the smallest numbers.
Do not fret, wife! This time we will make our fortune!<NL>I am sure of it!
Did you not say the same thing the last time? And the time before that? You will drive us into the poor house,<NL>you old fool!
No, my darling, no! This time, I have found it, I am certain! I have complete confidence in this most<NL>excellent product!
Ach! If I only knew where you kept this unshakeable confidence of yours, perhaps I could shake it out of you...
<color:#1>Confidence</color>, huh? Hey, Mr. Drippy, we could use<NL>some of that!
Indeed we could, my lad!
Uh, excuse me... Could we maybe borrow a little of<NL>your confidence?
Hm? Borrow my confidence...?<NL>Whatever do you mean?
Well, uh, we could maybe help you stop taking such big risks with your big sellers...
Ha ha ha! I doubt even the Ancients had the power to perform such miracles! But you are welcome to try!
Thank you. Could you hold still for just a moment?
...Oh my! What is this strange sensation?<NL>I feel...calmer. More...prudent...
I have caused my dear wife much worry... Perhaps I<NL>should think a little more before stocking up on<NL>this particular item...
Am I really hearing these words coming from your mouth, husband? This is thanks to you, is it not, boy? Truly, you are a worker of miracles!
This will be my next big seller, I am sure of it. Yes, I must stock up on these... My instincts do not lie! I have the utmost confidence!
Uh, excuse me, Sir...<NL>Could we maybe borrow a little of your <color:#1>confidence</color>?
Yes, I see now that guaranteed sales of staple items form the basis of sound commerce...
Hmm... If the desert continues to grow at this rate, the oasis on which the town relies will surely...
We must act swiftly to prevent such an occurrence...<NL>Yes, I must continue my research...
Is there some kind of problem?
There is. The desert is growing at a worrying pace. If we do not act soon, the oasis on which Al Mamoon relies will be consumed.
Flip, mun! This is proper serious!<NL>Something needs doing, and fast!
Yes. It does. This is why I am conducting research into plant life that will grow readily in desert regions.
With plants that only require a little water, the desert could be alive with greenery in no time at all.
Wow! That would be so neat!
So, these plants that en't too thirsty, do they exist, or are they just in youer head?
My research is only just beginning, but I will discover them! I must!
Well, don't drive youerself loopy trying to find them,<NL>will you?
I thank you for your concern.<NL>But I will not rest until my ambition is realized.
Your <color:#1>ambition</color>, huh? Hey, Mr. Drippy, do you think he maybe has some to spare?
I reckon he might, Ollie-boy!
Say, Mister, could you let us have some of your ambition so that we can help out people who need it?
It will help those in need, you say?<NL>Then of course you may have some!
Thanks so much!
Hmm...this is an intriguing sensation...<NL>My mind feels as clear as crystal...<NL>I must continue my research at once!
Neato! I'm glad we could help out!<NL>We'll be rooting for you!
Thank you. With your support, I am sure I can achieve my goal at last!
Perhaps I am merely dreaming, but my ambition is to discover plants that can grow even in the arid expanse of the desert.
Wow! That's some <color:#1>ambition</color>, huh, Mr. Drippy?
En't it, though!
I must continue my research!<NL>For the glory—and the future—of Al Mamoon!
Oh, it is a tragedy! How will my poor darling dear<NL>ever survive?
Something the matter, love?
My soul, my one, my only dearest husband has traveled to Golden Grove in search of delicious mushrooms—but he has forgotten to take his lunch!
Knickers!<NL>There's disastrous!
Yeah, I guess it is kinda bad, huh?<NL>He must be real hungry by now.
He must! Oh, he must! And the wild beasts of the forest prevent me from delivering it to him myself! Oh, whatever shall I do?
Golden Grove, huh? That's the forest we came through—the one with all those giant mushrooms.
That it is, Ollie-boy. The fertile forest of fabulous flora and fauna! It's a proper good place to go in search of a bit of grub.
Ah! So you are familiar with Golden Grove?
Then I must make a most urgent request of you.
It is a great inconvenience, I am sure, but this is an emergency! Please, you must deliver my dear darling husband's lunch to him!
You want us to take it to <color:#1>Golden Grove</color>?<NL>Sure! Leave it to us!
You will aid me in my hour of need? My little hero! Here, this is the lunch I prepared for my best beloved with all the devotion of a faithful wife!
You must not be tempted to try it, no matter how delicious it may smell! It is a meal for lovers only!
You will not help me in my hour of greatest need?<NL>By the Ancients! Whatever am I to do...?
And the wild beasts of the forest prevent me from delivering it to him myself! Oh, whatever shall I do?
Gee, he must be real hungry by now.
I hope my dearest darling husband has not collapsed with hunger... Oh, I am so worried! So very, very worried for my love!
We delivered your husband's lunch, Ma'am!
You did? Oh, you marvelous, marvelous boy!<NL>You truly are my little hero!
He gave us a message for you, too. It was, um...when youer apart, it's winter in his heart, but...er...when youer together...it's proper nice.
Oh me, oh my! My darling, darling dear! Hee hee!<NL>Thank you so much for giving me his message!<NL>My heart is all aflutter!
I must thank you somehow...<NL>Ah, yes. Here!
Ohhh, will my dearest darling, darling dear never come home? I do miss him so...
It is truly marvelous to be newly married!<NL>Such exquisite happiness!
Ohhh, this will never do...<NL>It is bad for business. Very bad...
The desert is filled with marauding <color:#1>boneheads</color>!
The traveling merchants who bring us fresh goods are being attacked. I fear that soon our lines of supply will be severed entirely!
If only there were someone who could rid us of those skeletal scoundrels...
Seems like they're in a proper pickle, eh, Ollie-boy?<NL>Shall we offer a helping hand?
I'll help you, Ma'am!<NL>I'll beat those boneheads for you!
Come now, child! We are not in so much trouble that we need to send the likes of you to your doom!
Nah, mun, you don't understand! He's got me—Drippy, Lord High Lord of the Fairies—looking after him! He'll be right as rain!
And what exactly will you do, little man? Gnaw upon their shinbones until they hop away? Hee hee hee!
Wh—!? You—! The flipping cheek of it!<NL>Flipping shinbones, indeed!
Ollie-boy, ouer pride is on the line here! We need to batter these boney beggars good and proper!
Sure! Let's do it, Mr. Drippy!
(sigh) Very well. Defeat <color:#1>ten boneheads</color>. That will be enough to allow our suppliers to reach us.
It is for the best.<NL>This is no job for mere children.
Brazen <color:#1>bonehead</color> bandits have been assaulting wandering merchants making their way across the desert sands.
Without the supplies they bring us, we will lose<NL>our livelihoods...
Hahahahaha! Oi, Doubting Dilys, we battered those ten <color:#1>boneheads</color> for you easy-flipping-peasy!
By the beards of the Ancients!<NL>Y-You...? But...how...?
Now your supplies can get through safely, Ma'am!<NL>Have a nice day!
I— I cannot thank you enough.<NL>You have saved my livelihood.
Please, you must accept this as your reward.
You truly intend to tackle the bonehead menace?<NL>I cannot be held responsible for what might happen<NL>to you, you know...
By the Ancients!<NL>You truly are tackling the bonehead menace!
But unless you can defeat another <color:#1><quest_exb009:qs0006></color>, I fear your efforts may be of little use. Perhaps you should give up while you still have your health...
You have defeated yet more of them?<NL>Only another <color:#1><quest_exb009:qs0006></color> to go! Do not give up now!
You have defeated yet more of them? There is only another <color:#1>one</color> to go! Do not give up now!
Our supplies are able to reach us once more!<NL>Praise be to the Ancients!<NL>And to yourselves, of course!
The goods I ordered have still not arrived.<NL>I hope nothing untoward has happened...
Where could they be?<NL>Loitering somewhere along the way, no doubt...
Are you waiting for somebody?
Hm? Oh, no, I am not waiting for people. I keep pigeons. It is for them that I am waiting.
I send them out to deliver messages across the land, but unfortunately, several have failed to return.
I worry that they may have flown the coop...
Gee, I sure hope nothing bad has happened to them.
No, no. This has happened before. They are probably drinking from the milk fountains. But I have messages for them to deliver...
If you have time, would you be able to find them for me?
Thank you so much! I would gladly search for the latecomers myself, but I cannot leave here in case they return while I am gone.
In all, <color:#1>three of my birds</color> have yet to return.
They must have all returned to Al Mamoon by now.<NL>I am sure you will find them somewhere in the city.
Leave it to the Lord High Lord of the Fairies, my lad! Youer feathered friends will be back before you can say "pigeon pie"!
Hee hee! Thank you!
I see. You are busy. I understand...<NL>But however will I deliver these messages...?
My pigeons are accustomed to human company.<NL>They will not fly away if you approach them.
It is likely that they are loitering somewhere in Al Mamoon. Please, return them to me as quickly as you can.
Thank you! One of my pigeons has returned to me!<NL>Now only <color:#1>two</color> are missing!
Thank you! Two of my pigeons have returned to me!<NL>Now only <color:#1>one</color> is missing!
I send my pigeons out to deliver messages across the land.
Unfortunately, several have failed to return.
No, no. This has happened before. I am sure they are merely loitering somewhere. But I have messages for them to deliver...
Hey, this bird—is it...?
Look at that, mun! This pigeon en't scared of people at all! Tame as anything, he is!
Hey, look at his little face!<NL>D'you think he's...?
...Trying to tell us something? Yeah, it kinda looks that way, huh...
Well, you know what to do then, don't you, Ollie-boy? It's time to use that <color:#1>spell</color> the Cowlipha gave you, en't it?
Coo! I don't want to fly home yet!<NL>I want to play here a little longer!
But there are messages that need delivering.<NL>You have to go back, little bird!
Squawk! You scared me silly!<NL>How can you understand me?<NL>Coo are you?
Never mind that, just go on home.<NL>Your master is real worried about you.
He is? Coo... But I have to fly so far away to deliver<NL>his messages...
Sure you do, but people need those messages.<NL>They're counting on you.
Coo... I suppose they are. They always seem so happy to receive them!
...All right. I'll go back home.<NL>Thank you for coming to find me!<NL>Coo! Coo!
Coo... I'm too scared to go home...<NL>I don't want to be eaten...
Huh? Eaten? What do you mean?
Coowee! You understand me?<NL>But you're a human!
I am. And your master asked me to come find you.
He did? Coo...
Did he seem...angry?
Last time I was late home, he said he would eat me if I ever did it again...
I'm sure he didn't mean it, little birdie! He was probably just angry because you bunked off work, en't it?
Yeah! He seemed awful worried about you.<NL>He really wants you to come home.
Coo... You really think so? All right.<NL>Thank you for coming to find me!<NL>Coo! Coo!
Hey, Mr. Pigeon! Your master is waiting for you to come home! You have to go back!
Coo!? Is that the time?<NL>I was miles away...
Sorry, I got distracted on my way home. I'll head straight back. Thank you for coming to find me! Coo! Coo!
Tidy! One down, two to go!
Just one more to find!
That's all of them!
Tidy! Let's go back and see Pigeon Boy then, shall we?<NL>I bet he'll have a nice thank-you for us.
How can I ever thank you? All my pigeons came home to roost thanks to you!
Here. I hope this is enough to express my gratitude. Please, you must take it.
I am so glad to see all my birds back home safe and sound. Thank you so very much!
Al Mamoon lies in the heart of our continent. This makes it the perfect place from which to send messages throughout the land.
This is why my carrier pigeons are so greatly in demand.
.........
Coo hoo hoo! I made it back home!<NL>Aren't I clever?
I'm so sad I made my master worry.<NL>I'll never be late home ever again.<NL>Coo! Coo!
Coo... It's so hot. It's always so hot. I'd love to go and have a nice bird bath in the oasis...
Curses... I lack the necessary ingredients...<NL>What to do, what to do...?
The recipe for the most legendary of Mamooni dishes has come into my possession, but I do not have the ingredients it requires...
What kind of dish is it?
It is known as the <color:#1>tikka mahala</color>.
According to the recipe, it is a complex and refined curry made with the tenderest and most succulent beef.
Crikey, that sounds like a proper tasty gobful!<NL>My mouth's watering just thinking about it!
Would you like to try it?
If you gather the ingredients for me, you will have the honor of being the first to taste the tikka mahala since ancient times!
Thank you! You are a most excellent and helpful young fellow!
Now, to create this masterpiece, I will need <color:#1>some fluffy rice</color>, <color:#1>some tender beef</color>, and <color:#1>a pinch of the Sheikh's special spices</color>!
The Sheikh's special spices?<NL>Where do we get those?
I am afraid I do not know for certain...
But I have heard that there is one known as the <color:#1>Sheikh of Spice</color> somewhere in this fair city.
Well that sounds like a good place to start, eh? Let's shake a leg and find ouerselves a Sheikh, shall we?
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask. Good luck, friends!
And to think I was so close to recreating the most fabled of all curries... Such a disappointment...
Curses... I lack the necessary ingredients...<NL>What to do, what to do...
The recipe for the most legendary of Mamooni dishes, the <color:#1>tikka mahala</color>, has come into my possession.
But I lack the ingredients necessary to complete this fabled curry.
Perhaps you would be kind enough to gather the ingredients for me?
I have no idea where you might find the Sheikh's<NL>special spices...
...but I do know that one who calls himself the <color:#1>Sheikh of Spice</color> resides in this fair city. He will surely be able to assist you.
I wonder what the fabled tikka mahala will taste like... Perhaps the day will soon come when I am able to try it<NL>at last!
By the Ancients! You have gathered all of the ingredients! I can create the legendary tikka mahala at long last!
I will begin at once! In but a short while, friends, you will be able to feast upon the most fabled of all curries!
Tidy! I can't flipping wait, can you, Ollie-boy?
I sure can't! Boy, oh boy!
You have my eternal gratitude. Thanks to you, the tikka mahala is no longer a relic of the past, but a living, breathing part of Mamooni culture!
This is surely not enough to compensate you for your troubles, but please, I must give you something for what you have done for me.
Welcome, welcome! Please, take the weight off your feet and sample some of my fine curries!
I have it at last! Now I can revive the legendary tikka mahala! I have waited my whole life for this moment!
It is no good. Without a model to inspire me, I shall never complete it...
The picture I am currently painting... I cannot seem to get it right, no matter how hard I try. The wellspring of my vision has run dry...
It has, huh? What kind of picture is it?
It is a study of the fierce and noble beauty of <color:#1>a girl child, wild as the hills and forests of our fair land</color>!
But I cannot seem to summon a clear image of her by imagination alone. This work requires the brutal clarity of the real!
If I could only find a suitable model, perhaps I would be able to capture the magic I seek!
It sounds like a real neat picture.<NL>I'd sure like to see it when it's finished.
You would? Then perhaps you will help me to complete it.
Will you find me a model who embodies my vision, and bring her to me?
Thank you! You are truly a patron of the arts!
The child I seek is <color:#1>a girl, wild as the hills</color>—a forest dweller, perhaps? She has short hair...and a necklace! Yes, the necklace is most important.
You will not? Then I have no choice but to find her myself. My apologies for troubling you.
I am trying to paint <color:#1>a girl child, wild as the hills and forests of our fair land</color>, but I cannot seem to capture<NL>her likeness.
If I could only find a suitable model, perhaps I would be able to shake off this creative malaise!
Will you help me to complete my masterpiece? Will you find me a model who embodies my vision, and bring her to me?
The child I seek is <color:#1>a girl, wild as the hills</color>—a forest dweller, perhaps? She has short hair, and wears a necklace.
May the Ancients aid you in your search.
By the beards of the Ancients!<NL>You have found her!
Yes! Yes, she is just as I imagined her! And her smile—such mysterious charm! This will be the greatest painting the world has yet seen!
You paint me good, yes?
But of course, child!<NL>Entrust yourself to my vision!
We sure are looking forward to seeing the finished picture. Good luck!
Thank you!
Oh, I almost forgot to reward you for your priceless contribution to the future of the arts! Here!
I thank you for bringing to me my muse.<NL>This painting will be my greatest yet!
What to paint, what to paint...?<NL>Whence will today's inspiration spring...?
This pose good?
Or this? This better?
Hmm...yes! ...Perhaps.<NL>Or perhaps not. Will you try another for me?
What this place?<NL>Many strange things here...
Phew! So much still to do!<NL>I must hurry!
You sure look busy today...
I am indeed! My tikka mahala has proved so popular that I have almost more orders than I can meet!
And since I began offering a delivery service, they have been pouring in from across the land!
I can't say I'm surprised, mun. That curry is almost scarily tasty. Proper amazing, it is!
But how do you keep it warm if you're delivering it to faraway places?
There's no need to keep it warm, mun!<NL>I bet it's just as good cold as it is piping hot!
Ha ha. Thank you. Your faith in my ability inspires me to work harder!
I do not regret my curry's popularity, but it means that I no longer have the time to carry out deliveries myself.
Perhaps if you have time, you might consider helping me?
I have orders from all over the land that I cannot hope to deliver myself.
Thank you once again! You are truly my savior!
Very well. The first delivery is to the <color:#1>Sheikh of Spice</color> here in Al Mamoon. Please, it must be delivered to him with<NL>all haste!
No worries, mun!<NL>Leave it to Ollie's Delivery Service!
You will not help? Curses...<NL>I was counting on your aid...
Will you at least enjoy some of my curry while you<NL>are here?
I need someone to deliver curries to the people who have ordered them...
The first delivery is to the <color:#1>Sheikh of Spice</color> here in Al Mamoon. Please, it must be delivered to him with all haste!
Ah, but perhaps you will enjoy some curry before you go?
The next delivery is to <color:#1>the most illustrious personage in all of Castaway Cove</color>! Please, it must be delivered with all haste!
The next delivery is to <color:#1>one who prides himself on selling every item under the sun</color>! Please, it must be delivered with all haste!
The next delivery is to <color:#1>one who is all bones</color>!<NL>Please, it must be delivered with the utmost haste!
The next delivery is to <color:#1>one who dwells in the forest to the west of Ding Dong Dell</color>! Please, it must be delivered with all haste!
Welcome back!<NL>The delivery went well, I trust?
I wish I were able to allow you a moment's rest.
But there are still customers awaiting deliveries of delicious curry! Will you oblige me once more?
Sure we will!<NL>Who's next on the list?
The next delivery is to <color:#1>the most illustrious personage in all of Castaway Cove</color>!
Castaway Cove. Got it!<NL>We'll be right back!
So sorry, but I have another order for you to deliver.<NL>The next is for someone in the Empire of Hamelin.
Hamelin!? Jeepers, the orders sure are coming in from<NL>far away!
Who exactly is it for?
Let me see, now... Curses! I have been so busy that my notes are in terrible disarray!
I cannot find the name, but it is for <color:#1>one who runs a shop that prides itself on selling every item under the sun</color>!
Well, that's not very helpful, is it, mun? You reckon we'll be able to deliver it based on that load of garbled old nonsense, do you?
We'll just have to do our best!
Hamelin is very far from here. Without your help, I could never have completed the order. Truly, you are my savior!
And I am afraid you will have to come to my rescue once more. I have just received another order. I hope you can oblige me.
Sure we can! Who is it for this time?
I am afraid I failed to catch all of the details...
Let me see, now...it was for, um...<color:#1>one who is all bones</color>! Yes...that is how the customer described himself.
Jeepers. It sounds like he needs that food real soon.<NL>I hope we can get it to him in time...
I seem to remember his location being somewhere that sounded most dark and foreboding...
Dark and foreboding. Got it!<NL>We'll be right back!
It sure did!<NL>Where to next, Sir?
Ha ha! You had guessed there would be another, I see.<NL>But thankfully, this will be the last.
The customer is <color:#1>one who dwells in a lost village hidden deep in a forest to the west of Ding Dong Dell</color>.
He heard rumors of my delicious tikka mahala, and decided to try it for himself. We must not disappoint him!
Roger! We'll be right back!
We did it! We delivered the last curry!
You did? Truly?<NL>I cannot thank you enough!
Everybody who ate it told us how delicious it was!<NL>You have a lot of satisfied customers!
This is music to my ears! To know that our efforts were not in vain is satisfaction indeed!
I am sure I have told you already, but truly, you are my savior. Please, accept this token of my eternal gratitude. Thank you.
Welcome, welcome!<NL>Will you try one of my delicious curries?
One taste of my incomparable curry is enough to bewitch even the most demanding of gourmands!
Travelers flock from all over the world to try the legendary tikka mahala!
Special delivery!<NL>One tikka mahala for a Mr. Sheikh!
And not a moment too soon!<NL>I had almost given up hope!
Lately, this most delectable curry is all I can bring myself to eat. All else pales in comparison.
You eat it every day?
But of course! It is the finest of all foods!<NL>I will never tire of it!
It is made with my very own special blend of spices, after all! How could it not be the very pinnacle of culinary excellence?
You, too, played your part in its creation, of course.<NL>And now, its delivery also. You have my thanks.
You're welcome, Mr. Sheikh, Sir!<NL>Thank you for choosing the Raj Mahal!
What to have for lunch, I wonder...?<NL>But of course! A delicious curry!
No matter how many helpings of tikka mahala I consume, I never grow tired of its depth and refinement. It is truly a culinary wonder!
Interesting. Very interesting. Unless I'm very much mistaken—which, of course, I'm not—you keep familiars. Am I correct?
Uh, yes. But...<NL>Why do you ask?
I think you'll find that you are just the person I've been waiting for. Excellent.
Eh? And how exactly will we find that?<NL>What are you on about, speccy?
I think you'll find that my name is in fact Derwin, and that I am a HIGHLY respected researcher in the field of familiarology.
I am currently in the area collecting important data on the creatures that can be tamed here in the more arid regions of the world.
Oh you are, are you? And don't tell me—youer too much of a wimp to go after them youerself, so you want us to help you, is it?
Precisely!
I would like to offer you the exciting opportunity to assist in some groundbreaking research by taming certain creatures, and bringing them to me for study.
Good. I hope you won't let me down.
Which creatures do you need us to tame, Derwin?
Let me consult my list here...<NL>Ahh, yes.
I need to collect data on <color:#1>a species of creature said to resemble a bunch of unripe babanas</color>, and <color:#1>one that wears a purple turban</color>.
If you bring them to me, I can cast my expert eye over them and make a few undoubtedly highly stimulating observations.
Oh, and I cannot study them if you send them to<NL>the Familiar Retreat, so please don't waste my<NL>time by doing so.
Run along, then. Bring them both back to me, and I'll be sure to acknowledge your contribution in my next fascinating paper.
Don't worry, speccy! We'll be back with the beasties before you can say "cryptozoology"!
You don't want to be part of scientific history?<NL>Your loss...
How would you like to help advance the field of familiarology?
Excellent. Oh, yes. Just look at that...
The bunching of the babaniform protuberances...possibly for defensive purposes? And the rich purple of the turban...I think you'll find that's to discourage predators...
Yes, these are indeed the creatures I wished to study.<NL>Not the best specimens, perhaps, but they'll do...
Gee... He could at least say "thank you"...
Yes, he flipping well could, the ungrateful little<NL>so-and-so...
Yes... Mm-hm... Some very interesting data... This will certainly raise some eyebrows in the familiarological fraternity...
It's no use, mun. Speccy here's in a world of his own. Come on, let's leave him to it.
...Oh. Here.
It certainly looks like a bunch of unripe babanas... Yes. This is the one.
Now, where's the other one? The one with the <color:#1>purple turban</color>? I think you'll find I instructed you to bring me two species.
Well, it certainly seems to be wearing a purple turban... Yes. This is the one.
Now, where is the one that <color:#1>resembles a bunch of unripe babanas</color>? I think you'll find I instructed you to bring me two species.
I really made some rather excellent observations there, even if the specimens you brought me were somewhat inferior...
Collecting data in these arid climes can be a struggle even for the most dedicated scientist. But I think you'll find it pays dividends...
Oh, I say! It's the young fellow I met in Ding Dong Dell! And here you are again, old thing! What are the chances, eh? Jolly good to see you!
It's good to see you too, Sir!<NL>Are you writing about Al Mamoon now?
Indeed I am! The desert is bally sweltering, but one can't say one has been on a world tour without squeezing in a little volcano viewing, dontcha know!
Jeepers! You climbed Old Smoky!?
Hardly! As my maiden aunt always remarked, I'm not the most courageous of fellows. But I did pootle around the foot of the old place a little, what!
And jolly well worth it, it was, too! It inspired me to write rather a marvelous little passage for my memoirs. Let me recite it to you...
...Oh, bother!
...Oh, dash and bother and confound it all!
Well, ah...I seem to have misplaced the old diary yet again, dashed fool that I am...
Jolly embarrassing, of course, given my solemn promise to you last time we met. I must seem rather a scatterbrained old lemon...
I say, you couldn't come to the aid of the party once more, could you, old stick?
Sure we can!<NL>Leave it to us, Mister!
Ahh, the fire of youth!<NL>Brings a tear to one's jaded old eye!
Never mind the fancy talk, you. Where did you drop the flipping thing this time?
Oh, ah, yes, of course... I seem to remember composing a little something whilst leaning against <color:#1>rather a fine old tree at the foot of the volcano</color> there.
Having been somewhat lost in the mists of creativity, of course, quite which tree escapes me. I didn't venture too far up the slopes, mind you...
Find the tree, and you'll find my diary, sure as eggs is eggs! Thanks awfully, old boy!
Well now, that's rather mean-spirited of you, I must say. Schools these days really are turning out the most frightful young ingrates...
Jolly good to see you again, old stick! Did I mention I've just been on a jaunt up the old volcano?
...Oh, dash and bother and confound it all! I seem to have misplaced the old diary yet again, damned fool that I am...
I say, you couldn't come to the aid of the party once more, could you, old boy?
If my suspicions are correct, I dropped it while composing a little something under <color:#1>a tree at the foot of the old volcano</color> there.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Sir!<NL>This is your diary, isn't it?
Oh, I say! You are a marvel!<NL>A treasure! A brick of the first order!
Try not to lose it again, okay?
Oh, absolutely! You have my most solemn promise, my vow as a gentleman, that it will never leave my sight again. Here! A reward, dear boy!
Thank you a thousand times over! I shan't lose my diary ever again, I give you my solemn word as a gentleman!
By criminy, it's bally well sweltering! I rather fear I may not be dressed for the occasion...
Looks like we've patched up the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
We'd best let him know, en't it?
Looks like we've patched up all the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
That'll be the end of it then, I s'pose.<NL>We'd best let him know, en't it?

If I do not take shelter in the shade, my skin burns most terribly...
A rich tan is a fine and healthy thing, but persons of true refinement prefer to maintain a milky pallor not seen in the babana fields.
Have you seen the fabulous fountains of milk? They overflow with the rich and creamy goodness of our beloved realm!
Sir! Behold this pot! Admire its surpassing artistry! Such handcrafted quality cannot be found in the Hootique!
You say that it is too hot? Nonsense!<NL>For us, this is a cool day!
Ahh, there is nothing so refreshing as a cool draft of milk when one has been running!
The girl you see over there is Esther.<NL>She is very beautiful, is she not?
What is the matter?<NL>Are you embarrassed by such talk?
Drinking milk helps us to grow big and strong.<NL>You would do well to drink your fill!
I came to draw off a draft of milk for my younger sister, but fool that I am, I forgot to bring a vessel in which to put it...
Where is my brother?<NL>I am thirsty! I want my milk!
Grandfather! Please may I have a chocolate babana? Pleeease?
I should very much like to look upon our beloved Cowlipha one day... She must be most radiantly beautiful...
What is the "pampurring" which occurs at the Palace of Pampurring? Tell me! I wish to know!
Your cape—does it allow you to soar through the skies like an eagle?
Ahh, this sunshine is truly a blessing! There is nothing so fine as a deep, rich tan, do you not agree?
What keeps my skin so silky smooth, you ask?<NL>Why, fresh milk, three times a day, of course!
Whatever can the matter be? We arranged to meet at the fountains of milk... Have I been...forsaken?
Excuse me? No, I'm not from Al Mamoon.<NL>I bought these clothes by mistake.
Have you carried out many errands and bounty hunts? If you do so, the rewards will help smooth your path through the trials of life...
No matter where one travels in the world, the old woman of the Hootique looks so similar. It is a great comfort to have such consistency...
Could we perhaps export our milk to other kingdoms in order to increase our wealth?
Those without permission may not enter!
So thirsty... Just one...glass of...milk...<NL>Ahem! Welcome to the palace of Al Mamoon!
Welcome to the illustrious city of Al Mamoon.<NL>Please, enjoy all that our home has to offer.
Come closer, Sir! Examine our fine wares!<NL>Such marvels cannot be found anywhere else!
Welcome, welcome! Al Mamoon is not famous for its babanas alone! Come, see our wondrous wares!
For reasons most obvious, milk is a staple ingredient in many Mamooni dishes.
What you see over there is not one of the famed fountains of milk. They are to be found in front of the palace.
The Palace of Pampurring is truly a paradise!<NL>You must try it for yourself, young man!
Is it not too hot to bear, you ask? Ha! We Mamoonis are famed for our prodigious endurance and most admirable restraint!
Let me see now...has any exciting new stock arrived of late?
The secret to a long and happy life?<NL>Why, a cup of milk each morning, of course!
Ahh, the children are so very happy and carefree!<NL>But then, so am I, I suppose! Hee hee!
Oh ho ho ho ho hooo!<NL>...Excuse me? Ogling the beautiful young ladies?<NL>Me? Do not be ridiculous!
You have just eaten a babana split, child!<NL>Do you wish to make yourself sick?
Haa, haa, haa...<NL>Soon I will have completed my one-hundredth lap!
I too will become a member of the guard, and protect our fair home of Al Mamoon!
...Hm? Protect it from what?<NL>That I do not know...
Welcome to the illustrious city of Al Mamoon, ruled over by the most munificent Cowlipha Lowlah!
My apologies. The Cowlipha is currently...indisposed. She is not accepting visitors.
Halt! You may not go before the Cowlipha without the permission of Master Abull!
After Golden Grove, it's on to Al Mamoon!
Did that bloke say Rashaad's selling babanas these days? Not exactly a step up from Great Sage, is it...
Knickers! I left my wallet back in flipping Ding Dong Dell, mun! Only kidding! Ha! Should have seen youer face!
Let's find this Rashaad, shall we, Ollie-boy?
Come on, Ollie-boy! Let's get over to youer world!
Get a move on! We've got to help Rusty, en't it!?
En't you got something you need to tell Myrtle?
Myrtle's all better! Tidy! Nice one, Ollie-boy!
D'you reckon this means Rashaad's daughter will be better now, and all?
Let's go and see that Rashaad's daughter, eh? She might be better, too.
Are you sure the Temple of Trials is this way?
What's wrong with you, mun?<NL>We need to go and see the Supreme Sage, en't it?
We're going nowhere fast until we pass those Trials, mun.
Come on, mun! Let's get down to the Temple and take that third Trial!
The Supreme Sage is waiting for us, en't he?
I know Solomon said to take a break, but that's no reason to go running off flipping miles away now, is it, mun?
We're s'posed to be heading for Al Mamoon, en't it?
We'll never stop that volcano from erupting if we don't get a flipping move on!
Reckon we've got a thing or two to be going and telling Rashaad, don't you?
Onward, to Castaway Cove!
We need to get after that dirty rotten thief, en't it?
Just going to let that stinking thief run off with the pot, are we?
Oi! Where are you off to, eh? The magic words for that pot are in the flipping Wizard's Companion, mun!
Come on, mun! Let's get down to Castaway Cove and set sail on the high seas!
We need to get that Cowlipha of Al Mamoon to let us borrow her boat, en't it?
The palace is all the way up the far end of town. Just follow the main street, mun. You can't miss it.
What's he want to paint Esther for? I'd make a much more refined model! Look at the fine, aquiline curves of my majestic nose! Hmph! The man's clearly an amateur!
Right, now we finally made it all the way back by here, let's get on and get the Cowlipha's permission to borrow her boat, shall we?
How much eating can this Cowlipha do, exactly? Sounds like she's got some kind of disorder, en't it?
First things first, let's go and have a sleep, shall we? I'm absolutely flipping knackered, mun!
You want to talk to Rashaad, do you?
Let's get over to youer world, shall we?
Crikey! The sight of her face when she was stuffing that cheese down! I've seen less scary Nightmares!
Why can't I see this Pea girl, eh? It's not fair! ...Bah, who cares. I'm not bothered. Not even slightly...
Let's try the milk fountain to the west out, shall we? I've got a good feeling about that one. Feel it in my lantern, I can...
There's plenty of milk in these fountains, mun! Just keep trying till you get it right, en't it?
How the heck do you know how to make cheese, Ollie-boy? Youer not as green as you are cabbage-looking, eh?
With magic on youer side, making cheese should be breeze! Take it a-whey!
Made a few sweets while you were at it, did you? Those things will rot youer teeth, you know!
I've never seen a piece of cheese so big, mun! It's flipping ginormous!
That's a tidy spell, that cooking spell, eh? I might get you to use it more often...
Let's have a look round the shops in Al Mamoon, shall we? We're bound to find something, mun.
Even the Cowlipha's brokenhearted... That Shadar's got a lot to answer for. A heckuva lot...
D'you get the feeling we're being watched? Ahh, it's probably nothing. Just one of my fans or something...
That Abull fellow had a proper heartful of restraint, didn't he? I should have known, mun...
That Abull bloke looked proper put-upon, eh? I reckon he must have restraint coming out of his flipping ears, mun!
Come on, mun, let's give the Cowlipha her restraint, back, en't it?
All we need to do is hand over that restraint, and— boom!—job done!
This piece of heart... It's not very...big, is it? And the Cowlipha...well, she...is, en't she? D'you reckon this is going to work, Ollie-boy?
If we head down to Castaway Cove, we should be able to ride that boat now, en't it?
Oi! We need to get back to Castaway Cove and retrieve ouer stolen goods!
Come on, mun! We need to go down to Castaway Cove and find us some restraint!
Let's go and hand over that restraint we got ouerselves, shall we?
That boat's going to leave without us if we don't get a flipping move on! Castaway Cove, and don't spare the ulks!
All aboard! Let's go and hit the high seas, en't it!
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
...Eh?<NL>Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.
We need to go and give those boys their pieces of art back, en't it.
S'pose we'd better go and make my mam laugh, eh?
Come on, mun! We need to get inside my mam, en't it?
We've got some unfinished business back inside my mam, mun!
We need to go and help those littlies!<NL>Pronto!
Come on, there's a slide in my mam's tum just waiting for us to go down it!
It's off to see the Empire, the wonderful Empire of Hamelin! In Autumnia!
Let's hurry up and get ouerselves to Hamelin, shall we?
D'you see any sages round by here?<NL>I flipping don't!
Reckon youer going to get some Hamelin armor round by here, do you? Well I flipping don't!
Oi, what do you think youer doing, ditching youer piggy armor and running off?
What exactly does this have to do with sneaking ouer way into the palace in Hamelin, hm?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?
We going back to the palace in Hamelin, or what, mun?
Let's get some belief off that Marcassin, shall we?
Come on, mun! Let's give Marcassin his belief back!
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
Itching to get over to Kublai's hideout, I am!
We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?
Let's hurry up and find that dragon's soul mate, shall we?
Motorville, mun! And make it snappy!
I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface? He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
Let's find that last stone shall we, mun?
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!
What do you reckon's going on with that soldier from Xanadu over in front of the palace in Hamelin, eh?
Time to take a trip on old Tengri, I reckon!
Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To get to Nevermore, we're going to have to cross the Miasma Marshes. And to do that, we're going to need the Clarion. So let's get ouer bottoms in gear!
You reckon there's any more guardians out there we can get orbs off and summon? With a few more of them, we'd be nigh-on unbeatable, Ollie-boy!
Not long till we reach Shadar's lair now, Ollie-boy! Scared? I know I flipping well am...
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea to, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
Al Mamoon's safe, mun! It's Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin we need to worry about now!
There's nothing to worry about with Pea on ouer side, eh? She's pretty flipping powerful for a littlie!
Crikey! The old Cowlipha turned into a proper mad cow, eh? This manna is serious stuff!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's no backstreets round by here, Ollie-boy. We're just going to have fight ouer way through!
If we can smash that black crystal thingy, everyone should go back to normal, en't it?
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
Smell that, mun! Spicy as you like round by here, en't it? There's exotic!
Crikey, it's hot! Can we go in the shade for a bit? Otherwise, you'll have to call me Puddly, not Drippy!
Am I going bananas, or are babanas just like bananas? A riddle and a tongue twister! There's clever of me!
Have you not got a sun hat, Ollie-boy? You want to watch out, mun. Sunstroke is no laughing matter. Not even for me...
I reckon babanas would taste proper tidy shaken up with a bit of milk. We could call it, um...a babana shakemilk!
You should have a read of youer Wizard's Companion once in a while, mun. It's the wizardly thing to do.
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
You sure youer familiars en't getting peckish, Ollie-boy? Best have a check, en't it?
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!
Wahey!
Any tasks you've not cleared up yet, Ollie-boy? Well worth doing, they are, if you can spare the time.
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!
No rush, Ollie-boy. Let's take it easy for a bit.

...!<NL>.........!
It's nice to see you again, Ollie!<NL>This city is quite something, isn't it?
Have you ever seen so many machines? If your idea of fun is tinkering with cogs and gaskets, this is the place for you.
It sure is!
Oh! So you like machines? I'm really keen on having a familiar from the Automata family myself.
And speaking of familiars, it looks like you've built up quite a monster menagerie!
Yeah, I guess. But it was mostly Esther.<NL>She sure is good with critters.
Well, maybe she can help you with my next question, then! I think you're going to like it!
Somewhere in your Wizard's Companion, there's a picture of the Wizard Wars that once raged throughout this land.
Squint hard at it, and you'll find some great examples of creatures from the Automata genus.
My question is this: <color:#1>how many creatures from the Automata genus are in the picture?</color>
As you're no stranger to familiars, I'm sure you'll get it right away. Let me know when you've got an answer<NL>for me!
Did you find that picture of the Wizard Wars in your Wizard's Companion?
And <color:#1>how many creatures from the Automata genus did you find?</color>
All you need to do is count the creatures from the Automata genus.
You got it, Ollie!<NL>Hmm...maybe that was too easy.
As you can tell from the picture, machines existed even at the time of the Wizard Wars.
Say, Horace—what were the Wizard Wars?
I know this one! They were those legendary wars from thousands of years ago, en't it?
If you think tragedy on a giant scale is legendary, then I suppose you could say that, yes. The picture doesn't do it justice, really...
But I suppose it's for the best that nothing survived to show how terrible it really was...
There's strange. He's speaking like he saw it with his own two eyes, mun!
Ah, so you're wondering how I know that picture isn't accurate... Can you work it out, I wonder?
How the heck are we s'posed to know?
Well, never mind. The important thing is that you answered my question, Ollie. Here's your reward!
Gee, thanks Horace!
Now, I think it's about time I had a look around this mechanical metropolis, so I'll be off.
When I get tired of all the smoke and noise, I'll be<NL>ready to try an island with a little more in the way<NL>of natural beauty...
See you again soon.
Just one last push, and the cure shall be complete! Ah, to see the smile on my dear sister's face will make it all worthwhile!
Well, there you have it.<NL>It was all an utter waste of time.
A waste of time?<NL>What do you mean, Sir?
It's my sister, you see. She has always been poorly, and I have devoted my life to trying to find a cure.
Gee, it sounds like you've both had a hard time.<NL>I hope you find that cure for her soon.
Hmph. I was on the verge of completing a remedy I felt sure would cure her. But now I wonder why I bothered...
Huh!? But you were nearly there!
I fear it has been a fruitless exercise.<NL>All those years I've wasted... Bah!<NL>Perhaps nothing can be done for her.
I am not going to spend the rest of my life on a fool's errand. I did my best, but it is over, and she must<NL>accept that.
Uh, Mr. Drippy...I think this man might be...
There's sharp, Ollie-boy! You've got it in one!<NL>He's heartbroken and no mistake. Lacking <color:#1>kindness</color>, he is.
If things stay like this, his sister will never get well, and he'll never be happy. We have to do something!
There's good of you, Ollie-boy! Now remember—it's <color:#1>kindness</color> we're after. Scribble it on youer hand so you don't forget!
There's cold! Just going to let his pooer sister suffer,<NL>are you?
I have spent years looking for a cure for my sister's illness, but I see now that it is a fruitless exercise. I shall waste no more time on this folly.
B-But how can you say that!?
This fellow's heartbroken, sure as anything. We'd best hurry up and find him some <color:#1>kindness</color>, for his pooer sister's sake.
Hang on! You've got a spot of <color:#1>kindness</color> by there, en't it, Ollie-boy? Well what are you waiting for?<NL>Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color>, mun!
What in the world have I been playing at!?<NL>Dawdling here while my dear sister suffers!
Neato! You got your kindness back!<NL>Now you're cured, it's time to cure your sister!
You have my deepest gratitude.<NL>Now, on with my research!
Ah, but it almost slipped my mind! Please accept this as a token of my appreciation for your sterling work.<NL>You have saved two lives today.
...Why did I bother?<NL>All those wasted years trying to find a cure...<NL>I must accept that my sister is beyond help.
Just one last push, and the cure shall be complete!<NL>Ah, to see the smile on my dear sister's face will<NL>make it all worthwhile!
The time is ripe! I shall propose to my beloved before nightfall!
Drat and damnation! Am I not a man?<NL>Why must I always lose my nerve?
Ummm, what's the matter, Sir?
It is a sorry tale, I'm afraid. There is a young lady whom I have known since my earliest days, and I had planned to ask for her hand in marriage.
Jeepers! That, um... That sure sounds romantic.
Romantic? Far from it, I'm afraid. I cannot muster the courage to say a single word in her presence.
I have known her all my life, and yet now I find myself going out of my way to avoid her.
Uhh...Mr. Drippy? I'm kinda new to this stuff...<NL>Is that normal, or...?
Sounds like a clear-cut lack of <color:#1>courage</color> to me. This pooer lad's brokenhearted.
And what are we going to do about it, Ollie-boy?
Well gee, we can't just leave him like this.<NL>We have to give him back his <color:#1>courage</color>!
That's the spirit! Youer a proper gentleman, Ollie-boy!
Leaving the pooer lad's love life in the lurch, are you? Well...I s'pose he'll live.
Oh, I did so want to propose to my beloved<NL>before nightfall.
And yet I find I cannot muster the nerve to say<NL>so much as a single word in front of her...<NL>(sigh) It never used to be this way...
I know what youer thinking, mun, but what we've got by here en't youer common or garden gutless wonder...
I get it! He's brokenhearted, huh?<NL>Shadar took all his <color:#1>courage</color> away.
Now, Ollie-boy, crack out <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and serve him up a generous helping of <color:#1>courage</color>!
I-I say! Why have I still not seized the moment and asked for my beloved's hand in marriage?
You just let your nerves get the better of you, I guess.<NL>But you're fine now, huh?
I have never felt better! The stars are in alignment!<NL>I shall win her hand before the day is out!
Thank you so much for listening to my woes.<NL>It seems to have done wonders for my nerves!<NL>Please, take this—for your admirable patience.
What is the matter with me?<NL>My nerve has totally failed me.
The stars are in alignment!<NL>I shall win her hand by nightfall!
Ah, there's nothing quite like an honest day's work!
Ah, there's nothing quite like an honest day's work...
...Except for an honest afternoon nap.<NL>(yawn) And I am feeling rather...slee...<NL>Zzzzzz...
Oi! Wake up, you idle lump!<NL>I pay you to work! Come on! Chop-chop!
(yawn) I'm sorry, Guv'nor.
What's got into you lately? Sleeping on the job? I ask you! Any more of that nonsense and you'll be for the high jump!
Right, Guv'nor. I'll roll up my sleeves and work hard,<NL>I promizzzzzz... Zzzzzz...
Hey! Wake up, Mister!<NL>Your boss will fire you if you don't!
Oi! You! Do you want this job or not?
Y-Yes! I love my work! It's just that when I get sleepy,<NL>I can't... I can't resist... I can't rezzz... Zzz...
I've got it! What Sleeping Beauty's missing<NL>is some good old-fashioned <color:#1>restraint</color>!
If he keeps hitting the sack, he'll end up getting<NL>the sack! So what's the plan, Ollie-boy?
We can't let him lose his job!<NL>We have to help him!
There's no time to lose, mun.<NL>Let's restore his <color:#1>restraint</color>, and fast!
Are you just going to let this pooer lad snooze himself out of a job? Proper harsh, that is!
The work's piling up... (yawn)<NL>Oh...if I could just have forty winkzzz... Zzz...
Oi! Stop sleeping on the job, or get used to not having one!
I-I'm so sorry, Guvnor! It's not that I don't want to work, honest! It's just that when I get tired, I can't... I can't resist... I can't rezzz... Zzz...
I've got it! What Sleeping Beauty's missing is some good old-fashioned <color:#1>restraint</color>!
There's no time to be lost, mun. Flex that wand of youers, cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color>, and restore his <color:#1>restraint</color>!
Huh!? Oh! What was I doing? This is a place of work,<NL>not a hotel!
So you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed at last.<NL>I was worried you'd snore me out of business.
There'll be no more of this napping nonsense!<NL>I'm ready to pull my socks up, roll up my sleeves,<NL>and get to work!
I owe you gentlemen my thanks.<NL>This isn't much, but I want you to have it.
I'll get to work, Guv'nor! I promizzzzzz...<NL>Zzz...
Right! There's work to be done!
Everything seems to be in order.<NL>Just the way I like it!
Oi! You in the cape! Just where in the world do you<NL>come from?
M-Me, Sir? Where do I come from?<NL>Ummm... Well, you see, the thing is...
Can't give me a straight answer, eh?<NL>I've got it! You're a spy, aren't you?
Huh!? ...A spy? No, Sir! That's not it at all!
That's quite enough of your backchat!<NL>I know a spy when I smell one!
Hold on! You're another one, aren't you?<NL>I've uncovered a whole spy ring!
Youer accusing the Lord High Lord of the Fairies of being a spy? A lovable character like me!?
Enough of your chatter! You're not from Hamelin, therefore you're a spy! End of bleeding story!
Oh, knickers! Either this guard's brokenhearted,<NL>or I'm a flipping spy! The suspicious so-and-so's<NL>lost his <color:#1>belief</color> in people, en't it?
If we don't do something, we'll be in a proper pickle.
Jeepers. What if he stops letting people through the gate? We have to find him some <color:#1>belief</color>!
Use youer head, Ollie-boy! If we don't help him,<NL>he'll stop folks from going through this gate.
Oi! You in the cape! Stop right there!<NL>I know a spy when I smell one!
N-No, you've got it all wrong, Sir!<NL>I'm not a spy!
Youer accusing the Lord High Lord of the Fairies<NL>of being a spy? A lovable character like me!?
Come on, Ollie-boy! You know the drill!<NL>Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and give this guard his <color:#1>belief</color> back.
...Hm? I-I say...<NL>What in the world have I been doing?
Neato! It looks like you're back to normal!
I'm sorry I doubted your intentions.<NL>I don't know what came over me.
By way of apology, I'd like to give you this.
If you don't hail from Hamelin, you must be a spy!
My research is coming on in leaps and bounds!<NL>With my trusty assistants by my side, we shall make Hamelin the envy of the entire world!
Confound it! I am coming to the end of my tether!
What's the matter, Sir?<NL>You don't look too happy...
I devote my every waking hour to inventing new<NL>machines, to doing my bit to hasten the majestic<NL>march of progress.
I know there are limits to what one man can achieve,<NL>but I simply cannot trust my feckless assistants.
You can't do it all on your own, Sir!<NL>You need other people to help you!
If only I could afford that luxury. If I were to leave my assistants to their own devices, they would steal my data and sell it to the highest bidder!
Gee... I feel kinda sorry for those assistants of his.<NL>If only I could convince him to give them a chance...
Save youer breath, Ollie-boy. This fellow here's brokenhearted, and it's his <color:#1>belief</color> that's in short supply.
If we don't help him out, he'll go on treating his pooer assistants like dirt, and scupper his research into<NL>the bargain.
Come on, Mr. Drippy! Let's help him get his research back on track!
There's good of you! Now we just need to find ourselves a bit of <color:#1>belief</color>.
Well, we have got plenty on ouer plate, I s'pose... I just can't help feeling sorry for those pooer assistants of his.
My research is in the most frightful rut.
Hmph. This fellow here's brokenhearted, and it's<NL>his <color:#1>belief</color> that's in short supply.
All right, I'm gonna cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and give this man his <color:#1>belief</color> back!
Hm? I must have been daydreaming... How could I, when there is research to be done! I can't leave it all to my faithful assistants.
Well, Sir, it looks like you've got your belief back!
My memory is rather hazy, but I feel certain that<NL>you have done something important for me.
I must show my gratitude. If you would do me the honor of accepting this small token...
There's a limit to what one man can do, but I simply cannot trust my feckless assistants.
I must apologize to my poor, put-upon assistants and then we can get on with our research once more. Onwards!
Once I've apologized to my poor, put-upon assistants, we can get on with our research once more. Onwards!
I fear my life's work has all been in vain.<NL>I have decided to abandon my research.
But Sir, weren't you going to make it up to your assistants by working even harder than before?
If only I could. I regret leaving my assistants in the lurch, but I cannot continue this charade.
Huh!? But why?
I have no gift for science. While progress marches on toward a brighter tomorrow...I remain yesterday's man.
It is time I admitted that no good will ever come of my amateurish tinkering. And knowing that...I have no choice but to retire.
B-But...you said your research was going so well...
Save youer breath, Ollie-boy! Lost his <color:#1>confidence</color>, he has.
I don't know what he's researching, but it'd be a proper shame to see him just give it all up...
We can't just watch him throw away his life's work!<NL>We have to help him out, Mr. Drippy!
Well, in that case, he's going to need an emergency injection of <color:#1>confidence</color>. Get to it, Ollie-boy!
Seems a shame to leave him so down in the dumps when he was about to get back to work...
I have no gift for research. While progress marches on toward a brighter tomorrow, I remain yesterday's man.
This fellow's brokenhearted. Lost his <color:#1>confidence</color>, he has. We have to help him, mun!
All right, Mr. Drippy—I know what to do! I just use <color:#8>Give Heart</color> to restore his missing <color:#1>confidence</color>, right?
How curious! My chest feels delightfully tingly.<NL>...Now what was it I was so worried about?
Never mind! There is not a second to waste!<NL>I must continue my research!
Neato! You got your confidence back!
Have you come to my aid once again?<NL>I don't know how to thank you.
...On second thought, perhaps I do.<NL>Please accept this small token of my gratitude.
I am convinced that I am on the verge of making<NL>a truly astounding discovery! I must crack on with my research. Onwards!
Grrr! Rrrargh!
Ruff! Ruff, ruff!<NL>Grrraaarrrgh!
That's enough, boy! Stop that infernal racket!<NL>...Why won't you do as you're told?
Are you okay, Ma'am?
Oh dear me! Please excuse my dog's behavior.<NL>I didn't mean to alarm you.
Crikey! There's a fierce mutt!<NL>It'll have youer hand off if youer not careful!
Grrraaargh! Rrrargh! Rrrargh!
Whoa! D-Down, boy...
Whatever's got into him?<NL>He used to be so quiet and obedient...
Hm. Them eyes don't look right to me...
What's the matter, Mr. Drippy?
Unless I'm very much mistaken—and I'm not—that pooer dog's heart is broken. Lost its <color:#1>love</color> for its owner, I reckon.
Jeepers! You mean pets can be brokenhearted, too!?
'Course they can! If you've got a heart, then it can be broken, en't it?
Right then! We'd best find a nice, juicy lump of <color:#1>love</color> for Fido here before he eats someone.
We can't just leave him like this! What if he gobbles up one of these juicy-looking porky fellows by here!?
Flipping heck! That mutt's heart is broken!<NL>It's lost its <color:#1>love</color> for its owner by the looks of it.
Right! Get out youer wand, cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color>, and put a bit of <color:#1>love</color> back into that pooer pooch's life!
...Aroo? (sniff)<NL>...Uff! (pant)
Hm? He's finally stopped his infernal barking!<NL>Good boy! Do you know, I think he might be back<NL>to his old self!
Gee, that sure is a relief!
My, my... You seem to have quite a way with animals! Thank you!
I have something for you.<NL>I hope it is to your liking.
Grrraaargh!<NL>Rrrargh! Rrrargh!
That's enough, boy!<NL>Stop that racket!
Arf!
My dog's very well behaved, don't you think?<NL>Good boy...
Cease! Desist! Stop your infernal barking!
He used to be so quiet and obedient.<NL>Whatever can have happened?
Is he not the most quiet, well-behaved dog you've<NL>ever met?
I am convinced that I am on the verge of making<NL>a truly astounding discovery! I simply must crack<NL>on with my research!
(sigh) No matter what I do, I feel so empty inside. ...Hm? Oh. I know you, do I not?
Sure you do, Sir! Say, you don't look so happy...<NL>Are you worried about your research?
Research? Pah! I have called it a day, I'm afraid.
Huh!? But why would you do that?
How can I put it...? I suppose I just couldn't see<NL>the point of it all anymore.
I have lost sight of my goals...of the high ideals that first inspired me to do my bit for progress.
But that's terrible... What happened?
Well you might ask, Ollie-boy. But you won't like<NL>the answer. He's lost his <color:#1>ambition</color>.
If we don't give him his dreams back,<NL>his research will never get done.
We can't just let all his hard work go to waste.<NL>We have to help him, Mr. Drippy!
In that case, we need to track down a generous<NL>measure of <color:#1>ambition</color>, sharpish!<NL>
So we came all this way just to leave the pooer bloke in the lurch, is it?
(sigh) No matter what I do, I feel so empty inside.<NL>What was my life's work in aid of?
Say, you don't look so happy, Mister.<NL>Are you worried about your research?
He's been robbed of his <color:#1>ambition</color>, mun! He'll never finish his research without it, pooer beggar!
Okay, it's time to cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color>, and give him back the <color:#1>ambition</color> he's missing!
Why, there they are! I can see them, clear as day!<NL>My goals! My ideals! My dreams!
This is no time for idle chitter-chatter!<NL>It's full steam ahead for my research!
It sure is swell to see you with all your old dreams<NL>back, Sir!
I do believe you have come to my aid once again.<NL>There are no words to express my gratitude.
...But I do have this!<NL>I trust it will be to your liking.
I have lost sight of my goals, the high ideals that first inspired me to do my bit for progress.
Oh, it's you! Thank you so much for all you've done for us both!
Now, we've been scrimping and saving, and almost have enough money to open our dream shop. We just have to decide on a location...
...But first I'm going to fill my face with cake! (burp)<NL>Then I'll eat ice cream till it comes out of my ears!<NL>And then... And then...
Hey! Haven't you had enough?<NL>You can't go on eating like this, dear...
Flipping heck!<NL>She's got an appetite on her, en't she!?
Yeah... I wonder why she's so hungry?
We've saved up a bit of money, haven't we?<NL>Let me enjoy it!
What are you on about? We scrimped and saved<NL>that money to open our dream shop.
Carry on like this, and we'll be back where we started, without two guilders to rub together.
There's no doubt about it. It's <color:#1>restraint</color> this lady's lacking.
If we don't do something sharpish, their hopes and dreams will disappear into her gob!
Sure, Mr. Drippy. We need to give her some <color:#1>restraint</color>, fast!
Youer just leaving her? But they'll never open their dream shop if you let her scoff all their savings!
(belch) First I'm going to fill my face with cake!<NL>Then I'll eat ice cream till it comes out of my ears!<NL>And then... And then...
H-Haven't you had enough?<NL>You can't go on eating like this, dear...
What are you on about? We scrimped and saved that money to open our dream shop!
You know the drill, Ollie-boy! Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color>, and serve her a healthy portion of <color:#1>restraint</color>!
Oooh, I feel all warm and tingly inside!<NL>...But also a little...full. Whatever have I been doing?
This money was to get our dream shop off the ground!<NL>I can't just keep eating into our savings!
There you go! Right as rain, she is!<NL>And it's all thanks to youers truly!<NL>You owe me one, Missus, and no mistake!
Mr. Drippy! You can't say that!
Ha ha! It's fine! He's right!<NL>We owe you a lot!
You've helped us through a tough patch yet again.<NL>Here, take this! It's our way of saying thank you.
And once I've finished all the ice cream,<NL>I'm going to get started on the cake...<NL>Mmm-mmm...
Oh my dear, darling husband! I fear my insatiable appetite has rather eaten into our savings...
Hey! I thought we were trying to save money!
You can't keep this up! We saved that money to get our dream shop off the ground.
Fear not, my dear! We may have to stay here a bit longer than we'd planned, but we'll have that money saved up in no time, you'll see!
In a huge city like this, there's bound to be plenty<NL>of folks we can sell our wares to.
Sniff that air! That's the smoky smell of progress!<NL>Truly, this city is a paradise for innovators of all stripes.
My experiment has succeeded!
Whoa! You sure seem happy!
Indeed I am. All of my efforts are finally paying off. I have taken a mighty leap towards the development of a new type of steam reactor!
Congratulations, Mister!<NL>That sounds just swell!
You are very kind, but my work is far from done!
I shall not rest until I have perfected my revolutionary steam reactor!
Crikey! Proper fired up, en't you!?
Quite right! One must have a passion for progress in all its forms! A brighter future awaits us all!
That lad's got <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> to burn, mun! Ask him if he'll give us a lend of it!
Uh, excuse me, Mister. Would it be okay if we borrowed a little of your enthusiasm?
Why, certainly! When one's pistons are pumping apace, it would be a shame not to share one's energy.
That sure is kind of you, Mister!<NL>Okay, here goes...
Ah, it is like a cool breeze has blown across my breast. ...But this is no time for flowery turns of phrase! It is time to work for a brighter future!
My experiment has succeeded! I am a giant step nearer to the completion of my peerless steam reactor!
That lad's got <color:#1>enthusiasm</color> to burn, mun! Ask him if he'll give us a lend of a bit!
Ummm... Excuse me, Mister. Would you mind sharing some of your enthusiasm?
Why, certainly! I have an unlimited supply of vim,<NL>vigor, verve, and vitality!
Gee, thanks!<NL>Okay, hold still for a second...
This is no time for idle banter. I must continue my work.<NL>A brighter future awaits!
My oldest friend is in quite a pickle.<NL>I must do what I can to help him.
I need work, and I shall leave no stone unturned<NL>until I find gainful employment!
Say, Mister. You sure seem happy for somebody<NL>who's out of a job.
What's not to be happy about? My best friend was out of work, so I stepped aside and gave him my job.
Jeepers! Are you sure that was a smart idea?
Oh, it was the very least I could do! Truth be told, it is scant repayment for all he has done for me over the years.
Wow! He sure sounds like a good friend.
Indeed he is! Jobs may come and jobs may go,<NL>but a friendship like that is irreplaceable.
I would happily give up my livelihood a hundred times over rather than see my poor friend suffer!
This here is no run-of-the-mill fellow.<NL>His heart's fit to burst with <color:#1>kindness</color>!
Say, would you be interested in helping somebody<NL>else out?
Help somebody else? Certainly!<NL>But are you sure I am the right man for the job?<NL>I would hate to let you down.
Trust me, you're the right man!<NL>Please, Mister! We need your help!
Ho ho! Well, since you put it like that!<NL>How could I possibly refuse?
Thank you, Mister!
Oh! This is a most strange sensation! But by no means unpleasant. Now then, young man, you'll always try to help out your friends, won't you?
I sure will! Gee...I hope me and Phil stay best pals when we grow up...
Well, he's shown you how it's done! Follow his lead, and you and Phil will still be best mates when youer old and gray and wrinkly!
Ha ha! You know, Mr. Drippy, you say really smart<NL>things sometimes.
...Sometimes? SOMETIMES!? I'm a flipping fount of wisdom, I'll have you know!
I was only too happy to give my job to my best friend.<NL>I would do anything to help him out.
Say, Mister, would you mind sharing some of<NL>your kindness?
Share my kindness!?<NL>Well, if such a thing is possible, then why not?<NL>I would be happy to assist you.
Now then! I must find myself some gainful employment!
Righto! I must ensure everything's in order for the royal procession. So much to do, so little time!
Splendid! All seems to be in order!<NL>Just the way I like it!
Is it your job to patrol the area, Sir?<NL>With all these folks around, you must sure be busy.
Pah! All in a day's work! What's a little effort if it helps keep Hamelin safe?
Wow! You sure do love your job! ...Say, when there's a royal procession, don't you just want to watch and cheer like everybody else?
Well, I am always so busy keeping an eye on<NL>everyone during processions that I really don't<NL>have time to think about things like that.
Gee! You don't even think about it, huh?<NL>You sure are dedicated to your work!
Ha! Well...there may have been one or two<NL>occasions when I've felt a cheer brewing—but I've never yet given in to the urge!
Not a single cheer, mun! Imagine that!<NL>Takes some serious flipping <color:#1>restraint</color>, that does!
It sure does!<NL>I don't think I could stop myself!
It is not my place to have fun. I must watch over<NL>you all so that you can enjoy such processions in safety.
Thank you, Sir!<NL>Ummm... I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.
Hm? Are you in some kind of trouble?
No, Sir, it's nothing like that. The thing is, it would<NL>be just swell if I could take a little of your restraint for someone who doesn't have any.
Take some of my restraint, you say? And this will help someone to control their unruly urges, will it? Sounds jolly good to me!
Thank you, Sir!
I say... I have a rather pleasant tingling in my chest.
I really appreciate it, Sir!<NL>Good luck with your guard duties!
Why, thank you. Your encouragement has inspired me to strive even harder in my work.
There are times when I would love to join in with<NL>the cheering crowds—but I must restrain myself. It's my job to keep everyone safe, after all.
Now that's what I call self-control!<NL>Got <color:#1>restraint</color> coming out of his ears, this one!
Ummm... Excuse me, Sir. Would you mind sharing a little of your restraint?
We need it to help people who've had their<NL>restraint taken away from them.
You mean to tell me that my self-discipline could<NL>help someone to control their unruly urges?<NL>Well, in that case, be my guest!
Righto! Another day devoted to keeping<NL>the Empire safe! Splendid!
So...very...very...hungry...
I'm starving, but I am far too busy to concern myself with frivolous pastimes like eating.
Are you sure you're okay, Mister?
Oh, do not concern yourself with my well-being!<NL>I am just rather...peckish. I haven't eaten since yesterday.
But if you don't eat something soon, you'll faint,<NL>Mister!
Young man, I am at a critical juncture in some<NL>deeply important scientific work—and you suggest that I simply stop? To EAT!?
Do not worry about me. I shall control my appetite for now, and eat my fill when—and only when—my work<NL>is complete.
B-But...
Now, let Dr. Drippy diagnose this case. This fellow's got more than his fair share of <color:#1>restraint</color> and it's driven him a bit barmy.
If we don't grab a bit of his heart quick-smart,<NL>he'll collapse, pooer beggar!
You couldn't spare us a little bit of youer heart,<NL>could you?
A piece of my heart, you say? Well, I suppose so.<NL>...You do know what you're doing, don't you?
Sure we do!<NL>Now, if you could just hold still for a second...
Oh! I say! I've never felt so hungry in my life.<NL>My stomach thinks my throat's been cut!
Without some nourishment, I will surely collapse,<NL>and what good would that do my research?<NL>I do declare, it is time to dine!
I think that's for the best, Sir.<NL>I sure hope you enjoy your meal!
Ah, I thank you. I have learned a valuable lesson today. Too much restraint can be bad for one's health.
I am starving. But I am at a critical juncture in my work. I shall control my appetite until my research is done.
This fellow's got more than his fair share of <color:#1>restraint</color> and it's driven him a bit barmy.
You couldn't spare us a little bit of youer heart,<NL>could you? Before you go and collapse in a heap.
Now, I must fortify myself before I continue my work.<NL>But what to eat? Decisions, decisions...
Developing new technology is deeply rewarding,<NL>but it is far from easy.
Developing new technology is far from easy,<NL>but it is deeply rewarding.
Gee! It sure sounds like you love what you do.<NL>What are you working on right now?
Well might you ask...<NL>I am afraid I cannot work at present.
Huh!? Why not?
It's my chief engineer—he came into the laboratory the other day and told us that he had decided to abandon his research for good.
But what would make him do something like that?
I have not the faintest idea.<NL>But I am sure it will all work out in the end.
He was always a man of vision, and that can't change overnight. Someday, he will dust off his lab coat and return to his research.
Gee, Mr. Drippy, he sure does have a lot of <color:#1>belief</color> in his boss!
Youer spot on there, Ollie-boy.<NL>You couldn't do us a bit of a favor, could you?
A favor, you say? Well, I don't see why not.<NL>Tell me what I can do for you.
We'd like you to share your belief with others.<NL>Don't worry, it's not as weird as it sounds!<NL>Just hold still for a moment...
Oh! I feel rather peculiar!
Thank you very much!<NL>I hope you get back to work soon!
I have no doubt I shall be back to work before long.
The chief engineer is man of vision.<NL>I know that someday he will dust off his lab coat<NL>and return to his research. I have faith in him!
I must be ready to resume my work at a moment's notice.<NL>I know the day will soon come!
I've found myself in my wife's bad books, I'm afraid.<NL>She lost her temper, and threw me out of the house.
Jeepers! That's no good!<NL>What made her lose her temper?
Well, for years we have always celebrated our<NL>wedding anniversary together, just the two of us.
But this year, I had to work, and she didn't like that one little bit. So here I am, out on the street.
Trouble in paradise, seems like!
Oh, it's nothing serious! It will all blow over.<NL>She's a bit sad about spending our anniversary<NL>apart, but I don't think she's really angry.
She's a wonderful wife, even if she sometimes<NL>has trouble expressing her feelings.
Look! The Locket is glowing!
Crikey! I think we've found ourselves a heart<NL>full to the brim with <color:#1>belief</color>.
Sorry to trouble you, Mister, but I was wondering if we could ask you a favor...
A favor, you say? Certainly. Why not? Now that I am out on the street, I have precious little else to do.
Thank you very much, Mister!
I say! Are you some sort of wizard? Well, whether you are or not, you've made my heart feel light as a feather!
I'm in my wife's bad books, but I know that she'll forgive me in the end. She has trouble expressing her feelings, but she's a wonderful woman.
Got some serious faith in his missus, en't he?<NL>That heart of his must be full to the brim with <color:#1>belief</color>!
I'm sure my wife will let me back into the house before too long...
Now then, what book shall I devour today?
Let me see...<NL>What book shall I devour today?
Gee... These books sure look difficult...<NL>Are you going to read them all?
Of course! I plan to pore over tomes on physics, engineering, the wonders of steam... And magic,<NL>of course!
Boy, you sure do study an awful lot!
Ha! I have yet to even scratch the surface! There is so much still to learn. After all, I plan to become Hamelin's preeminent scientist!
Crikey!<NL>That's big talk for a little piglet!
Hang about! Ollie-boy! The Locket's lit up!
You're right, Mr. Drippy! It looks like this boy has a heart full of <color:#1>confidence</color>.
I don't suppose I could ask you to share some of your confidence with us?
Share my confidence? Well, as long as it doesn't interfere with my studies, I don't see why not.
Don't worry! All you have to do is hold still for a second.
Well, that doesn't sound too hard.<NL>Is this still enough for you?
That's perfect. Okay, here goes!
That's amazing! Was that...magic?
This has been a most educational experience.<NL>Thank you!
I've set my sights on becoming Hamelin's preeminent scientist. All I have to do is keep on studying, and my future is assured!
Wow! I don't suppose I could ask you to share some of your <color:#1>confidence</color> with us, could I?
Let's see how many books I can devour today!
Oh, there's nothing I like more than watching a<NL>royal procession with my darling hubby beside me!
Ah, I can't wait to watch the next royal procession with my darling hubby beside me! Somehow it never gets boring!
You sure seem excited, Ma'am! Do you and your husband watch all the processions together?
Every one, yes! It's always been a special thing<NL>that we do together.
Every single one, huh? You sure must like each other an awful lot.
Oh! Well, I suppose we do!<NL>Thank you, young man.
My poor darling works all hours, and only gets a<NL>day off once in a blue moon. But he always finds a way to join me when there's a royal procession.
You have no idea how happy I am that he always<NL>makes the effort. I just can't put it into words!
Your husband must care for you very much.
Oh, he does. And I love him from the bottom of<NL>my heart.
There's romantic! She's practically got little hearts floating round her head, she's so full of <color:#1>love</color>!
Ha ha! It sure looks that way.
Uh, excuse me, Ma'am—I wonder if you could<NL>maybe help us out?
Help you?<NL>What do you need help with, young man?
There are people in this world who don't have any love in their hearts.
And I was hoping you might be willing to share a<NL>little of the love in yours.
Why, I'd be delighted! But do you really think<NL>I can help?
Sure you can!<NL>Now, please hold still for a second...
Oh! Ho! That tickles!<NL>Well, have you got what you need?
My dear hubby always makes the effort to join me for royal processions. I love him from the very bottom of<NL>my heart.
Look, Ollie-boy! She's practically got little hearts floating round her head, she's so full of <color:#1>love</color>!
Excuse me, Ma'am—we were wondering if you'd<NL>be happy to share the love in your heart with<NL>folks that don't have any at all.
If it will help people, then I'd be delighted.<NL>...But do you really think my love can make<NL>a difference?
Sure it can!<NL>Now, please hold still for a second...
Certainly...
I can't wait for the royal procession to begin!
Oh dear, dear me. This simply will not do.<NL>They will never be ready in time.
What's the matter, Ma'am?
Oh, young man! I am in quite a predicament.<NL>I wanted to give my mother flowers for her birthday, but this plant just will not blossom!
Her birthday is just around the corner, and yet<NL>this stubborn plant refuses to cooperate.
No wonder the pooer dab's flustered. Her mam's<NL>going to be none too pleased.
Couldn't you put your heads together and come<NL>up with some way to help me?
Ummm... I'm sorry, Ma'am. I'm afraid I don't<NL>know much about flowers...
Come on, Ollie-boy! Youer a wizard, en't you?<NL>With flipping <color:#1>magic</color> and everything! There must be something you can do!
Magic, you say? Oh, please help me out!<NL>I would be ever so grateful!
Okay, I'll try. I mean, it would be too bad if your<NL>mother was disappointed on her birthday.
Thank you ever so much, young man.<NL>I'm counting on you.
Turning youer back on people in need?<NL>That's not the wizard's way, Ollie-boy...
I wanted to give my mother flowers for her birthday, but this plant refuses to cooperate, and simply will not blossom.
At this rate, they'll never be ready in time...<NL>Is there anything you can do to help?
Stop youer fretting, Missus! I'm sure a spot of<NL><color:#1>magic</color> will save the day!
Magic, you say? Oh, please help me!<NL>I would be ever so grateful!
If only this stubborn plant would blossom!
I've heard tell of a <color:#1>creature that looks like the sun</color>.<NL>I wonder if it might convince my plant to blossom?
Hold on a minute! Didn't you have a spell that<NL><color:#1>makes plants grow quicker</color>?
Blooming marvelous! ...Hang about!<NL>It didn't flipping work!
You're right, Mr. Drippy.<NL>Maybe I should try it one more time?
It's no use, Ollie-boy. Using that spell willy-nilly<NL>will just shorten that pooer plant's life.
Oh, how awful! We wouldn't want that.
I reckon what this plant needs is a decent dose of sunshine.
I am afraid that sunshine is in rather short supply here in Hamelin. Oh, this plant will never blossom!
Don't get youer knickers in a twist, Missus!<NL>There may be another solution, like.
I forget where I heard it—but someone said <NL>something about a very interesting creature that <color:#1>looks just like the sun</color>!
That's it! If we could get that critter to shine its light on the plant, it might blossom!
There's sharp, you are! That's just what I was thinking,<NL>Ollie-boy!
Okay! Let's go find it!
We found you the next best thing to sunshine, Ma'am!
How extraordinary! It really does look just like<NL>the sun!
Let's get it to shine its light on your plant!
Neato! The flowers are blooming!
Youer not wrong, Ollie-boy!<NL>Feast youer eyes on those beautiful blooms!
Oh, they are simply exquisite!<NL>My mother will be over the moon!
Swell! We got the plant to flower in time for your<NL>mother's birthday!
Thank you ever so much, young man.<NL>I would be honored if you would accept this.
Thank you for all you have done for me. My mother will be simply over the moon when she sees these flowers.
Flowers are rather thin on the ground in Hamelin,<NL>you see. Oh, she will be delighted!
Hmmm... Those buds still aren't opening.<NL>But they look pretty close...
This is a calamity! My supplies have run dry!<NL>And I was so close to finishing!
Is something wrong, Sir?
I was on the verge of completing this medicine for my poor ailing sister, but I have run out of ingredients.
Geez, what rotten luck.<NL>You must be real worried about her, huh?
Yes, indeed I am. At present, she is convalescing in Castaway Cove, but if I could cure her, she could home and live with me.
You mean she's stuck there until you finish making her medicine? Jeepers... No wonder you're working<NL>so hard.
I actually have a small favor to ask of you, if I may.
Would you be so kind as to collect some <color:#1>feel-good fungus</color> for me?
You would? Oh, that's simply splendid!<NL>That would be a huge help.
You should find <color:#1>feel-good fungus</color> growing in the <color:#1>forest to the west</color> of this city.
Okay, Sir. Leave it to us!
Thank you so much.
Ah. I see. Well, if that is your answer...<NL>I suppose my poor sister will just have to wait a<NL>little longer to come home...
I was on the verge of finishing the medicine I've<NL>been working on, but I have run out of a vital<NL>ingredient. Yet I must have it ready...and soon!
You sure do seem to be in a hurry, Sir.
Indeed I am. I am preparing this medicine for my poor, ailing sister.
So that's why you're working so hard.
I couldn't trouble you for a favor, could I?
While you are off hunting for that ingredient,<NL>I shall continue mixing the medicine.
I say! Sterling work!<NL>You have found the vital ingredient!
Now, one more push and I shall have this medicine complete! Oh, to see my sister's smiling face...
Well, I sure hope your sister gets better soon.
Now that I have everything I need, it should not<NL>take long to prepare the medicine.
I am truly grateful to you for what you have done.<NL>Please take this as a reward for your efforts.
Now I can complete the preparation of the medicine. Thank you so much!
With this medicine, my sister should be cured in no time. Oh, I cannot wait to see her smiling face.
Is there no end to my trials?<NL>And just when I had finally prepared the medicine!
Is something the matter, Sir?
I am afraid things are looking rather bleak. With your assistance, I had finally managed to prepare the medicine for my poor, ailing sister.
Really? Wow! Congratulations, Sir!<NL>Now you just have to get it to her!
Well, yes. But there's the rub.
The seas between here and Castaway Cove have<NL>been plagued by pirates of late. They say it is too<NL>perilous for ships to set sail.
Jeepers! That's awful! But isn't there some other<NL>way to get that medicine to your sister?
I have racked my brains, but cannot think of one.<NL>I have even considered swimming all the way there.<NL>For my poor sister, I would do anything...
Whoa! But you can't swim all the way from here<NL>to Castaway Cove!
Hang on! Before you go dusting off youer<NL>swimming shorts, why not let us take care<NL>of those pirates for you? Right, Ollie-boy?
R-Really? You would take on those scoundrels<NL>yourselves? But they're cold-blooded killers!
Don't you worry about us! They don't stand<NL>a chance against Drippy, Lord High Lord of<NL>the Fairies—and his faithful human sidekick!
Well, if you are sure... I would be deeply indebted to you.
The pirates are plaguing the <color:#1>sea route to Castaway Cove</color>.
Reports say there are a total of <color:#1>four ships</color> in their fleet. Please do be careful, won't you?
Don't worry about us! Those pirates won't know what's hit 'em, will they, Ollie-boy?
What!? Youer not flipping serious, are you?
There I am, courageously volunteering ouer services in the fight against pirates, and what do you go and do!?
You made me look like I'm all mouth and no trousers! Young people today! I ask you!
Gah! My poor, ailing sister awaits this medicine in Castaway Cove, and I cannot get it to her!
Why can't you get the medicine to her, Sir?
Stop youer fretting and let us take care of those<NL>flipping pirates for you? Right, Ollie-boy?
We gave them pirates what for, just like we said we would!
You did? Why, that is an extraordinary feat!<NL>I salute you!
I wish you could've been there to see me in action!<NL>I gave them a left, then a right, then another left...
Hundreds of them, there were—no, thousands!<NL>But they were no match for a fairy's fury.<NL>Chucked them all overboard, I did.
Don't exaggerate, Mr. Drippy! You were just<NL>watching most of the time.
Flipping heck, Ollie-boy! You really know how to pick youer moments, don't you?
Ho ho ho! You are quite a pairing. I haven't laughed like this in a long time!
But you have given me far greater cause to smile<NL>than that. Because of you, my sister will have her<NL>medicine at last. I am...inexpressibly grateful.
I would like to thank you for all you have done for me. This is for you.
Now, I must deliver this medicine to my sister.<NL>I cannot wait to see the smile on her face!
At long last, the medicine is ready!
Here you go! Special delivery!<NL>One red hot curry for you, Mister!
Huh!? But you're—!?<NL>Since when did you start working as a delivery boy?
Raj who makes the curry was awful busy,<NL>so we agreed to help out.
Ho ho! So that explains it!<NL>Well, good luck!
You're going to have your work cut out for you!<NL>I've heard this curry has fans all over the world.
I'm sure we'll be fine.
I hear those folks over in Al Mamoon are going<NL>wild for some curry or other. I don't normally go<NL>in for foreign food, but I can't deny I'm curious...
...Bleedin' heck! This is a curry and a half, all right! No wonder folks are crawling over 'emselves to get a taste of it!
(yawn) Getting up in the morning is such a struggle...
Oh... I've slept in again... That makes it four hundred and fifty-six days in a row... (yawn)
Don't you have an alarm clock, Mister?
I've got more alarm clocks than I know what to do with. The problem is, not one of them seems to do the trick.
I've tried big ones, small ones, ones with bells,<NL>whistles, hammers... But I slept through them all.
There is one kind I haven't tried yet, though—an<NL>alarm clock which I've heard very good things about. That's what I'm looking for now.
What kind of alarm clock is that?
It's called a <color:#1>sleep-be-gone</color>... Listen, you wouldn't help me look for one, would you? All this blasted searching is wearing me out...
You will? Why, that's marvelous.<NL>Now, this whole business has been rather...tiring...
Good...luck... (yawn)
He'll be snoring his head off in a minute, the lazy beggar!
Yeah... We need to bring him that alarm clock right away, huh?
Oh, you won't? Very well. I'll just have to... (yawn) ...have to, um...do it my...self... (yawn)
So...sleepy... Looks like I've slept in yet again.<NL>That makes it four hundred and fifty-six days in a row... (yawn)
If only I could get my hands on one of those<NL><color:#1>sleep-be-gone</color> alarm clocks... That would wake me up all right!
Listen, you wouldn't help me search for one,<NL>would you?
If ever a man was in need of a <color:#1>sleep-be-gone</color> alarm clock, it's me... (yawn)
Oh! This is it! The alarm clock I've heard so much about!
It looks like it's got a powerful ring to it...<NL>Zzzzzz...
Look, mun! The lazy beggar's nodded off with his eyes wide open!
Uh...wake up, Mister!
...Huh!? Oh... Do excuse me...
"Sleep-be-gone" my flipping rear!<NL>What a waste of time!
I'm really not sure this is going to do the trick.<NL>I wonder if I could ask you one more favor?
What is it, Mister?
Would you be kind enough to bring me a<NL><color:#1>cappuccino</color>? That...would...be... Zzzzzz...
Zzzzzz... Mmm... Tasty, delicious...<NL>Mmm... <color:#1>Cappuccino</color>... Zzzzzz...
Mmm... That's a fine-looking cappuccino!<NL>Thanks! It's bound to put a spring back in my step!
Please excuse me while I sample it.
Woo-wee! I've never felt so wide-awake!
Neato! It looks like it worked!
Ah... That's better... I've never felt so...<NL>Very...very...sleepy...
Flipping heck! I've seen some lazy beggars in my time,<NL>but this bloke takes the biscuit!
This is most strange...<NL>How can I still be sleepy?
Huh!? It sure wore off fast!
I've felt sleepy before...but this is something else... I feel completely...drained...
This fellow's in a bad way, mun!
Is there something else that could keep him awake?
Perhaps if you had a <color:#1>familiar</color> that knew a trick like <color:#1>Rise and Shine</color>...
All right. Maybe that could work. We'll bring you<NL>a critter like that as fast as we can!
Do what you can... Pleazzzzzz...
Zzzzzz... A <color:#1>familiar</color>...that knows...<color:#1>Rise and Shine</color>... Zzzzzz...
Hey, Mister, we brought that critter you wanted!
Let me see! Ah, yes! That looks like a familiar a<NL>man could rely on.
Do you think we could get it to use <color:#1>Rise and Shine</color><NL>right away?
Oh! Woo-wee! I've never felt so bright-eyed and<NL>bushy-tailed! My sleepiness has been banished!
Thank you! You've done so much for me.
Flipping right we have! I've met some flipping lazy beggars in my time, but youer a flipping phenomenon!
Ha ha! Your fairy does say the most amusing things!<NL>Well, anyway, here's something for your troubles.
I can't wait to wake up tomorrow at the crack of dawn!
Oh, it's you. It seems our paths have crossed once again.
I predicted that you'd come this way, of course.<NL>And that is why I took the liberty of lining up a<NL>task for you.
Hi, Derwin!<NL>What is it that you want us to help you with?
I think you'll find it's along the same lines as last time.
To assist me in my vital research, I require that you bring me three very specific creatures. Now, do you wish to help the progress of science, or hinder it?
Those clumsy disguises cannot fool me, I'm afraid. My eye is far too discerning.
Gee, Derwin! I can't believe you recognized us!<NL>You sure are one smart cookie! What is it that you want us to help you with?
Good. That was the correct answer. I shall proceed. I have always wanted to research certain curious creatures that inhabit this area.
What kind of creatures are they, Derwin?
I applaud your curiosity. The creatures in question belong to the Automata genus—about which science still has much to learn.
In the name of progress, I would like you to find me a <color:#1>large mechanical creature</color>, a <color:#1>small mechanical creature</color>...
...and finally, a creature that takes the form of a<NL><color:#1>brown cog</color>.
It goes without saying that it will not suffice to<NL>simply stash these specimens in a Familiar Retreat.
No, you must bring all three of these creatures<NL>to me together.
Hmph. So you refuse to treat my research with<NL>the respect it deserves? I weep for science...
Sorry to keep you waiting, Derwin!<NL>Are these the critters you were after?
This is simply marvelous!<NL>Science salutes you!
Gaze at their cold, inorganic beauty!<NL>Behold the dull gleam of their bodies!<NL>They are perfect specimens!
But I cannot gawp at them gormlessly all day.<NL>I must collect data! And lots of it!
Ummm... Derwin...
It's no use. He's away with the fairies, Ollie-boy.<NL>Nothing but creatures on his mind, that one.
...Oh. Apologies! I was momentarily absorbed<NL>in matters which are too complicated to explain.<NL>Please accept this for your services to science...
The subjects of my current study are as follows...
A <color:#1>large mechanical creature</color>, a <color:#1>small mechanical creature</color>, and a creature that takes the form of a <color:#1>brown cog</color>.
In the name of progress, I want you to find me specimens.
It goes without saying that it will not suffice to<NL>simply stash said specimens in a Familiar Retreat.
It would appear that you have successfully<NL>identified a large mechanical creature and a<NL>brown cog-shaped specimen...
I think you'll find that what you're missing is a<NL><color:#1>small mechanical creature</color>.
It goes without saying that it will not suffice to<NL>simply stash the specimens in a Familiar Retreat.
It would appear that you have successfully<NL>identified both a large and a small mechanical<NL>creature...
I think you'll find that what you're missing is a<NL><color:#1>brown cog-shaped creature</color>.
It would appear that you have successfully<NL>identified a small mechanical creature and a<NL>brown cog-shaped specimen...
I think you'll find that what you're missing is a<NL><color:#1>large mechanical creature</color>.
It would appear that you have successfully<NL>identified a brown cog-shaped specimen...
I think you'll find that what you're missing is a <color:#1>large mechanical creature</color> and a <color:#1>smaller mechanical specimen</color>.
It would appear that you have successfully<NL>identified a large mechanical creature...
I think you'll find that what you're missing is a <color:#1>small mechanical creature</color><NL>and a <color:#1>brown cog-shaped specimen</color>.
It would appear that you have successfully<NL>identified a small mechanical creature...
I think you'll find that what you're<NL>missing is a <color:#1>large mechanical creature</color> and a <color:#1>brown cog-shaped specimen</color>.
My research continues to push the boundaries of human understanding. I thank you. And science thanks you.
I thank you for your assistance with my research<NL>back in Al Mamoon.
I say, it's you, dear boy! It feels like an absolute age since our jaunt on that delightful fairy island, what? You have impeccable timing, you know!
Uh...do we?
Ten guilders says he's lost his flipping diary again...
B-But...how?
Looks like I won our little bet, don't it, Ollie-boy?<NL>Careless so-and-so...
I am most dreadfully ashamed. There I was, merrily pootling along the open road when some loutish monsters assailed me.
I took fright and fled to this city, the nearest outpost of civilization I could find...
And then you thought you'd write all about it in<NL>youer precious diary, only to find the thing had gone missing again, am I right?
Precisely! My gift to literature had vanished once again! But you'll help me find it, won't you, old bean?
Well, I guess we can help you find it again, Mister.
You will? Oh, I say, that really is<NL>awfully good of you.
Hold on, mun! If you were being chased by monsters, you could've dropped it just about flipping anywhere!
Well, I think I can enlighten you as to my general<NL>locale at the time of the incident. I had happened upon the most intriguing little mine...
Overcome by curiosity, I couldn't help popping in for a quick poke around. And that's when the beasts arrived...
So you got surrounded by monsters?
Yes, that's about the size of it. So if I were to hazard a guess, I would say the diary is on the <color:#1>railway tracks near the mine's entrance</color>.
So it's on some <color:#1>railroad tracks near the entrance to a mine</color>... Got it!
I really am most grateful, dear boy.
Dear boy! I beg you to do this one favor for me!<NL>I swear I shall never drop that bally thing again!
Dear boy, it feels like an absolute age since our jaunt on that fairy island! You have impeccable timing, I must say!
Got it in one, I'm afraid. I seem to have dropped<NL>it in my haste to escape from some thoroughly<NL>unsporting monsters.
My gift to literature, gone...!<NL>But you'll help me find it, won't you, old bean?
If I were to hazard a guess as to the diary's whereabouts, I would say it fell on the <color:#1>path near the mine's entrance</color>.
Just be on the lookout for that monstrous mob!<NL>They don't care a jot for gentlemanly rules of conduct!
We found your diary, Mister!
But if I ever hear you say you've lost youer<NL>"bally" diary again...you and me will have a<NL>proper falling out, boyo!
You have my word as a gentleman that I shall never misplace this diary again. Now, please take this.
Behold the triumph of man over nature!<NL>Steam! Pulleys! Gears! Smoke! Noise!
...In Hamelin, I have seen the future!<NL>Gosh, I am jolly glad my wanderings brought<NL>me here, dear boy!
Looks like we've patched up the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
We'd best let him know, en't it?
Looks like we've patched up all the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
That'll be the end of it then, I s'pose.<NL>We'd best let him know, en't it?
This city was founded on the twin pillars of science and magic. Believe it or not, Hamelin was once full of wizards and alchemists.
Back when I was knee-high to a piglet, I used to<NL>study a bit of alchemy myself.
Wow! What kind of things did you learn?
Ah, it is rare to meet a young person with real<NL>enthusiasm for the subject.
...Hold on! Is that a cauldron you've got there?<NL>Could you really be a wizard?
Yes, that's right! I mean, I only just started...
Well, I'm sure you have a bright future ahead of you. ...In fact, perhaps you could make use of a few formulae I came up with in my youth.
Gee! Really!?
Certainly. The thought of a new generation keeping the flame of alchemy alive brings a smile to my face.
You received some new alchemy formulae!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
Ah, I remember those days...<NL>Just me and my cauldron...<NL>What bliss!
Bounty hunt complete!<NL>Report to Swift Solutions to collect your reward!
Flipping heck! Not again!<NL>How many of these things are there!?
And in the blinking palace and all!<NL>Who'd have thought it?
Flip! And there en't any guards because they're all off getting ready to give the White Witch what for, en't it!
That means it's up to us, Ollie-boy!
Don't go rushing into anything, Ollie-boy!<NL>I've got a bad feeling about this, and my feelings<NL>en't often wrong!
We'll have to deal with this at some point, Ollie-boy.<NL>It'll only get worse if we just ignore it.
Examine the black orb?
Welcome to one of the Cat's Cradle chain of<NL>purremium inns! We purride ourselves on being more convenient, safer, and cheapurr than the rest!
Your custom is always apurreciated!<NL>Have a nice nap!
We are purroud to offer a wide selection of rooms. And remember—your custom is always apurreciated!
With more rooms than any other Cat's Cradle,<NL>we leave the inn in Al Mamoon in the shade.
Look at youer Wizard's Companion, Ollie-boy!<NL>It looks like it's got bigger!
The memories of all the travelers who've stayed here are filling it back up! Tidy!
I trust you had another purrfect night's sleep<NL>at the Cat's Cradle? Travel safely now!
And remember: your next nap is never far away!
Welcome to Swift Solutions, where those in need come to watch their worries fly away!
People with more troubles than they can swallow will place notices on the bulletin board over there. Check it regularly to see if you can help out.
Hm? Hoo's there? Oh, hello.<NL>Hoo can I help you today?
Owl be seeing you soon!
Caw! A customer! I don't mean to crow, but our wares are the finest in the land!
With these prices, we must be raven mad!<NL>Come again soon!
The impertinence! Do you not know that it is<NL>forbidden to wear clothes like that?
Put some pig armor on and do it smartish!<NL>We won't have any of this free-thinking!
One minute they ban "unsolicited laughter,"<NL>the next it's eye-contact...<NL>Soon they'll ban us from breathing!
I am one of the engineers forging the future of the Empire—which is to say, I'm a very important chap.
Now, you look like a traveler to me. Have you ever seen streets as wide as we have here?
We are lucky enough to have regular royal processions. Have you managed to catch one yet?
Just once, I would love to sit up on the Royal Train and have the crowds cheering me! Just imagine!
Laws are a fine thing, are they not? Without them, our splendid city would collapse into chaos.
This is one of the best views in the city,<NL>and that is what progress looks like!
Last week they banned us from pointing.<NL>This week, they stopped us eating mashed potato. I reckon next week, they'll ban us from sleeping.
Oi! This ain't a place for bleedin' children like you! Go on! Clear off!
Is there anything like the texture and aroma of a<NL>high-grade black truffle? No. No, there isn't...
Rules and regulations... Laws and guidelines...<NL>Just how far is this going to go?
I've lived here all my life, but those royal processions never get old! All that pomp and ceremony!
I can see you're not from Hamelin...and that you<NL>have some serious magic power up your sleeve.
While others may treat you like a foolish child,<NL>I can tell you're anything but...
Ho ho! Hello, young fellow. Whatever could you<NL>want with a decrepit old boy like me?
...But then, beneath this armor, I suppose you don't know how old I am, do you? We all look the same...
We've had four new laws already this month,<NL>forbidding this, that, and the other...<NL>How can we ever hope to keep track of them all?
Look at you, with your fancy red cloak!<NL>I wouldn't mind one of those myself...
Have you sampled our local black truffles?<NL>You should, they're exquisite. Pricey, though.<NL>They'll cost you a trotter and a snout.
There is such thing as having too many laws, you know! Folks need a little bit of freedom!
Our empire is marching bravely towards the future! With science on your side, anything is possible!
If you love steam and smoke, gadgets and gears,<NL>this is the city for you!
Listen to this! My wife got a fancy new hairdo, right? Then she goes and gets angry at me for not noticing!
What's that? You're wondering what we do when we're thirsty?
Why, we simply stick a straw through the snout hole and slurp our drinks through that. Easy, right?
I have absolutely no talent for magic, but thanks to the sorcery of science, I can live a comfortable life.
I want to pay my beloved a compliment, but what am I supposed to say?
Your snout holes are perfectly shaped!?<NL>...That's no way to win someone's heart.
This is the mighty realm of Hamelin, ruled over by<NL>the Porcine Prince.
You've got a funny pet! He looks rather odd,<NL>but loveable all the same.
Deary me. I'd love to show my grandchildren the stars, but all the smoke and dirt in the air makes it impossible.
Harnessing magic and science, Hamelin has forged all sorts of new and exciting weaponry.
Head to the Cawtermaster's Store, and you'll be<NL>bowled over by the wares on offer!
Oh, you're a dashing young man, aren't you?<NL>I could just pinch your cheek!
You're not traveling by yourself are you?<NL>Where are your mummy and daddy?
Right at the center of our royal processions, you'll see our brave and heroic ruler, the Porcine Prince!
These suits of pig armor aren't all bad, you know.<NL>I can eat as much as I like, and no one will notice<NL>if I pile on the pounds!
Our climate is actually quite cold, but you wouldn't know it with all the heat generated by the machines here.
I'd dearly love to dress up, but we all have to wear these ugly great pig suits...
I plan to meet my sweetheart later today, but it is hard to get excited when you're dressed as a giant pig.
This is the age of science! Magic is so old hat!
Mummy! What do the stars look like?
My father is a famous engineer!<NL>I bet you're really impressed!
Look at this gate! Amazing, isn't it?
My father said that even a train coming at full speed wouldn't leave a dent in it!
This gate is opened for royal processions.<NL>Take care not to get too close to it.
Oh, guarding the city all day gets rather dull.<NL>Why don't I get to enjoy royal processions?
You can keep your scientific advances.<NL>The power of magic still can't be beaten.<NL>
This is just between the two of us, you understand...
There's no one in this city who manages to obey<NL>every single one of the rules and regulations.
There are as many laws as there are stars in the sky. How could you hope to memorize them all?
The gates are firmly shut.
It's off to see the Empire, the wonderful<NL>Empire of Hamelin! In Autumnia!
Why not take that fellow's advice and<NL>do a spot of sight-seeing, mun?
You really reckon there's a Great Sage living<NL>amongst all this hustle and bustle?
Acting a bit funny, wasn't he? Still, it's not like youer world en't got its fair share of weirdos!
Buildings that flipping move?<NL>It's not natural, mun!
That bloke can have his uses sometimes.<NL>...But only sometimes, mind.
Flipping heck! All these laws sound proper strict.<NL>I'm going to end up in the clink at this rate.
Full of beans, Swaine is today, mun. A little too full if you ask me...
This Black Market sounds proper dodgy to me.<NL>Watch youer step, Ollie-boy.
He's a bit of a pain in the neck that Swaine, but he's useful to have around, en't it though?
So... Heard any good jokes recently, Ollie-boy?
What are you gawping at me for, mun?<NL>Youer making me uncomfortable.
What is it? What do you want, mun?
If you don't want the guards to lay their trotters on you, you've got to stay out of sight. Don't rush it, mun!
It looks like the guards have a set route they follow. Or am I just being daft?
If we squeeze ouerselves into those spaces along the walls, we can just wait and sneak past. Easy, en't it?
I'm not going to run away. You can trust me, mun!
We'd best squeeze ouerselves down that hole.<NL>Hurry, mun! There's no time to lose!
Tidy! I've got the perfect camouflage!
What are you doing!? This is no time for a flipping chinwag—run, mun, run!
What you need is a tidy disguise like mine!
What are tanks doing trundling round inside<NL>a flipping palace?
That rotter Shadar's left all the powerful folks<NL>brokenhearted. You've got to save the day, Ollie-boy!
Time to head back into town, I reckon!
Hamelin's a big old place, mun. Someone by here's bound to have some belief to spare!
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?
We going back to the palace in Hamelin,<NL>or what, mun?
Let's get some belief off that Marcassin,<NL>shall we? His future self needs a dose.
Marcassin's heart is full to the brim with belief in that big brother of his. Bound to do the trick, that is.
So Swaine used to be Gascon, is it?<NL>Never mind. Forget I said anything...
Hurry up and hand over that belief, mun! We'll be in a right old potch if the guards come busting in!
This is youer big moment, Ollie-boy! Give Heart!<NL>Don't tell me you've flipping forgotten!
We've got to help that piggy prince!
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
Itching to get over to Kublai's<NL>hideout, I am!
We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?
Let's hurry up and find that dragon's soul mate, shall we?
Motorville, mun! And make it snappy!
I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface?<NL>He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
Let's find that last stone shall we, mun?
They're the wrong flipping size!? Wish we'd noticed a bit blooming earlier!
At times like these, you can't beat a Great Sage!<NL>Let's speak to Marcassin, quick as we can.
There's handy! Now we can warp our way around Hamelin! That'll save us getting blisters.
Let's have a little think about things while we walk.
Don't look so flipping worried, mun!<NL>With me on youer side, you'll be fine!
So Marcassin wasn't a lot of use, was he?<NL>Let's see what Rashaad's got to say.
Is it me, or is that guard a bit on the see-through side!?
What's that guard doing carrying a flipping spear!?
Folks from Xanadu in Hamelin? What are they<NL>playing at, I wonder?
Time to take a trip on old Tengri, I reckon!
Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell,<NL>the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the<NL>cheeky little blighter.
Doing that with just youer claws? There's more to old King Tom than meets the eye! And there was me thinking he was just a fat, lazy furball!
Now we just need to get Marcassin to apply the<NL>finishing touches!
I wonder what kind of sound this Clarion makes.
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and<NL>Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and<NL>Hamelin left to save now, mun!
Hamelin's safe, mun! It's Ding Dong Dell and<NL>Al Mamoon we need to worry about now!
There's nothing to worry about with Pea on ouer side, eh? She's pretty flipping powerful for a littlie!
I've never seen a tank like that, mun!<NL>S'pose that's progress for you, en't it?
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
It's a flipping long hike to the Porcine Palace.
If we can smash that black crystal thingy,<NL>everyone should go back to normal, en't it?
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
A mechanical town, they call it. And this is the future? Hmph. I'm not sure this science thing will last.
They must be burning a heck of a lot of coal to drive all these contraptions. En't they worried it'll run out?
Look! The flipping lantern on my nose is covered in grime! The air here's filthy!
Look at the size of this place, mun! It's a heckuva long way to walk from the city gates to the palace.
Why pigs!?<NL>Does the Prince have a thing for porkers, or what?
Let's start the new day as we mean to go on, shall we? Best foot forward, and last one in's a rotten egg!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
Wahey!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
You talking to me or chewing a brick? Sorry, mun. Just wanted to try and sound tough. Pretty convincing, eh?
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
In a big old place like Hamelin, there's bound to be someone who's got what we need.

...!<NL>......
Ollie! There you are!<NL>You crossed the desert too, I see!
...But what exactly are you wearing?<NL>You look ridiculous!
Well...we didn't really have a choice. Everybody has to wear a swimsuit here in Castaway Cove.
Ah, swimming... I used to love being in the water. But it's not quite the same when you're a ghost. You don't even get wet.
Gee, I'm sorry to hear that...
Ha ha! Don't worry about me, Ollie! There's plenty of good things about being a ghost! ...Hey, is it me, or do you look like someone who's taken the Trials?
Ha! Taken them? He didn't just take them, shorty!<NL>He passed them with flying flipping colors!
He did, did he? Well, bully for him! Come and show off to me when they're calling him the Sage of Ages!
As polite as ever, I see.<NL>Big-headed little so-and-so...
Anyway, it looks like you're well on your way to becoming a sage now, Ollie. I suppose your Nazcaän is coming along nicely, too?
My, uh...nas...car?
"Nazcaän," he said. It's a language people used to speak ages ago. Proper ancient, it is. There's bits of it in youer Wizard's Companion, if you look.
Well, well! So you do know something after all,<NL>pip-squeak!
Yes, the very first Wizard's Companion was written in Nazcaän script...
And there are still bits and pieces of it in modern editions like yours, too. That's why every copy contains a guide to the Nazcaän alphabet!
Wow... That's pretty neat.
I'm glad you think so, Ollie, because I've prepared a special puzzle for you—one that'll test your Nazcaän comprehension!
Now, open your Wizard's Companion and turn to the page headed <color:#1>The Tools of Wizardry</color>.
If you look closely, you'll see some ancient<NL>Nazcaän script there...
Your task is to try and decipher it!<NL>Let me know when you've worked it out!
Did you look at the page headed <color:#1>The Tools of Wizardry</color>? You just need to decipher the <color:#1>Nazcaän</color> that's written there!
I'm talking about the Nazcaän that's actually part of the original picture, of course.
Anything else on there is probably just doodles done by a bored apprentice wizard...
What's that? You can't read Nazcaän? There's a whole section that teaches you how in the back of the<NL>Wizard's Companion.
Well done! Yes, we wizards should always wear robes woven from the finest of fibers.
Mine are made of material from the Sky Tree!<NL>How about that?
Really? Neato! My clothes are made from the<NL>Sky Tree, too!
Wh-What!? But...only sages are allowed to wear Sky Tree clothes! You're not a sage! Hmph!
Now, now, Midgetface! Don't get in a tizzy! The old lady down the Hootique gave us them for free, en't it,<NL>Ollie-boy?
F-For free...?<NL>You flukey little...
And here I am about to give you something else brilliant... But I suppose you did solve my puzzle. Here.
Thanks, Horace!
Pah. Don't mention it. It's the least I can do for another wannabe sage.
Now, I think it's time for me to move on again.
I think I'll stow away on one of the ships that visit the harbor here. No one's ever going to spot me, after all!
Good-bye for now, Ollie!
There are plenty of ships leaving the harbor here.<NL>I think I'll sneak onto one of them and set sail for<NL>pastures new!
Ah... Such warm sun, such cool breeze...<NL>Truly, this is fishing weather!
Curses...<NL>What is this affliction I suffer?
Uh... Are you okay?<NL>You don't look so good...
I... I have always been a man of the sea.<NL>Becoming a fisherman, it was my only ambition.<NL>Ever since I was a babe in arms.
And indeed, I was recently able to finally acquire my very own vessel...
Oh, wow! That's great!<NL>Congratulations!
I am grateful for your kind words, but... (sigh)<NL>I suddenly find myself to be most terribly afraid of the ocean. The ocean I have always loved...
I simply cannot bring myself to go fishing.<NL>What has become of me, I do not know...
A fisherman who's suddenly scared of the sea...?<NL>Mr. Drippy, it sounds like he's—
Brokenhearted, en't it? Lacking <color:#1>courage</color> he is, no doubt about it. You going to help him out, Ollie-boy?
I sure am! I mean, he just got his own boat!
Right you are, then! Let's see if we can find some <color:#1>courage</color> for ouer fisherman friend!
Youer just going to leave him like this!?<NL>Hmm... Doesn't seem right to me, mun.
My fear of the ocean, it consumes me...<NL>What has become of me, I do not know...
Brokenhearted, en't it? Lacking <color:#1>courage</color> he is, no doubt about it. We've got to help him, Ollie-boy!
Fishing... It has suddenly become unthinkable...<NL>I simply do not understand...
Right then, cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and restore that fisherman's <color:#1>courage</color>, en't it!?
...Hmmm? Ohhh! Praise be to the Ancients!<NL>Courage swells within my breast once more!
Neato! So you're not scared of the sea anymore?
Not in the slightest!<NL>Indeed, I shall take to the waves forthwith!
Ah... But first I must show my gratitude.<NL>Please, accept this by way of thanks!
Ohhh... I do want that elegant bathing suit so...<NL>But hard-earned guilders must not be wasted on such frippery!
My purses are nearly empty...<NL>And yet there is so much more that I wish to buy!
I simply must have the very latest bathing suits!<NL>Why must I be denied!?
Gee... You sure do seem to like shopping.
Oh! Look at that! It is perfect! Simply TOO perfect!<NL>I must have it! Oh! And that one also...!
Flipping heck, mun, she's not even noticed us!<NL>She just can't stop ogling that peddler's wares, looks like.
Uh...Miss? Excuse me, Miss! A-Are you sure it's a good idea to be buying all those things? Only...you mentioned you didn't have that much left...i-in your purse, I mean.
Please, do not get in my way!<NL>There is so much that I need to buy!
You don't have to buy it all right now, though.<NL>Maybe you should save up a little first...
Do not trouble me with such petty considerations!<NL>I DO have to buy it all immediately!<NL>I WANT it! Do you not see!?
It sounds to me like this girl is in need of a big dollop of <color:#1>restraint</color>, Ollie-boy...
Hadn't we better do something...?
Yeah... She can't keep spending all her money like that!
Tidy! Let's find her the <color:#1>restraint</color> she's missing then, en't it?
You really en't going to help her?<NL>She'll end up in the pooer house at this rate, mun...
Please! PLEASE! Do not disturb my shopping!
But you said you didn't have any money...<NL>Maybe you should save up a little first?
Oh! That one is simply magnificent!<NL>I must have it! I must have it immediately!
Look sharp, Ollie-boy! Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and lend that girl some <color:#1>restraint</color> before the demon debt gets her!
Hmm? Whatever am I...?<NL>...What is going on here?
Phew! It looks like she's back to normal.
Was it...? Was it you who put an end to my...my compulsion?
That's right! Drippy, Lord High Lord of the Fairies, at youer service!
Mr. Drippy! This isn't the time to be showing off!
I dread to think what would have become of me had I continued my relentless shopping... Please, accept this—<NL>a small token of my thanks.
Oh! Such an elegantly decorated bathing suit...<NL>But...I have no need for it!
Ah... There is no finer place in the world than the home of one's fathers...
There is no reason for me to stay in this town. I shall leave, and find a place where I might live on my own!
Live on your own!? What in the name of the Ancients is this madness!?
Uh... Is everything all right?
Ah! Perhaps you can make my brother see sense! He is claiming that he wishes to live alone, outside of town!
Huh!? But it's too dangerous!<NL>There are so many monsters out there!
Ha! I would rather live among monsters than among the two-faced citizens of this town.
Everyone here thinks me a fool!<NL>They tell me otherwise, but I do not believe a word!
But that is simply not true, Brother!<NL>No man thinks you a fool! Not one!
Silence! I do not believe you!<NL>I do not believe anyone in this town!<NL>I have had enough of your lies!
He doesn't believe anyone at all...?<NL>It kind of sounds like he's brokenhearted, huh...
No doubt about it, Ollie-boy.<NL>He's lacking <color:#1>belief</color>, en't it?
All right, Mr. Drippy! Let's go find him some <color:#1>belief</color>!
Eh? You en't going to help him? But he'll head off on his own if you don't. Pooer dab'll be a monster's dinner before he knows it...
There is no reason for me to stay in this town! I shall leave, and find a place where I might live on my own!
Live on your own!? What in the name of the Ancients...!? Please, you must put a stop to my brother's madness!
Everyone here thinks me a fool. They tell me otherwise, but I refuse to believe a word! I refuse to believe any<NL>of them!
I do not believe you!<NL>I do not believe anyone in this town!<NL>I have had enough of your lies!
Right then, Ollie-boy! Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and restore the pooer lad's <color:#1>belief</color>, en't it!?
I was going to leave the home of my fathers...<NL>I was unable to trust anyone here...
But...you no longer feel that way?
I do not! Dear brother, forgive me. I caused you great concern, I am sure...
Now, it would appear that you were responsible for bringing me to my senses. Thank you. Please, accept this.
Ah... There is no place like one's home!
The fact that we live and work together is a source of great comfort to me, dear brother...
I do not know what I would do without your friendship and guidance.
What is this madness!?<NL>Why this sudden talk of leaving town!?
Why do you not believe us?<NL>We are your friends! Your family!
It is such a relief, knowing that my brother will not be leaving...
Ahhh... My life, it is truly blissful...
Oh dear... Oh, what am I to do...?
What's the matter, Miss?<NL>You seem kinda worried...
Oh... Yes. It is my beloved. I no longer feel...anything towards him.
Gee... That sounds kinda sad...<NL>Did he do something wrong?
No. He has been a perfect gentleman.
I... I simply do not care for him anymore.
Well, these things happen, mun. He probably wasn't right for you, en't it? Best move on, I say. Plenty more fish in<NL>the sea!
But...though I love him no longer, I still cannot bear to be apart from him.
Oh, what am I to do...?
Uh... This is really weird.<NL>Do you know what's going on, Mr. Drippy?
You know what, Ollie-boy? I reckon she's brokenhearted. Properly, like. Someone's pinched her <color:#1>love</color>, en't it?
Come on, Mr. Drippy! Let's go find some <color:#1>love</color> so this couple can live happily ever after!
Tidy, let's get cracking!
Youer not going to help her?<NL>But I reckon she's in a proper bad way, like...
No. He has been a perfect gentleman. I simply do not<NL>love him anymore. And yet...I cannot bear it when we<NL>are apart...
I do not love him—that much I know.<NL>Why then can I not be without him?<NL>Oh, what am I to do...?
You've got a hunk of <color:#1>love</color> burning a hole in youer Locket, en't it, Ollie-boy? Then cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and help this pooer dab out!
Oh my... I do not know why, but...I cannot wait to see my beloved! I must tell him how much I love him!
Oh, great! You, uh, like him again, then?
Of course I do! I love him!<NL>I love him as much as I did the day we first met...
Thank you, young man. You have saved me. I feared I would never know true happiness...
Please, take this—though it can express only the tiniest fraction of my appreciation!
I must go and see my beloved right away!<NL>I simply must!
The Ancients have blessed us with fine fishing weather! Let us ready the nets and set sail anon!
Ach... Why ever did I choose this accursed profession...?
Huh? But I thought you weren't scared of the sea anymore?
Oh, I am not fearful. It is just that...I no longer see the point. Perhaps fishing is not for me...
What!? Why?<NL>You just got your own boat and everything!
But what good is one boat? (sigh) I could fish for forty days and forty nights, but what would it truly achieve?
When I was a boy, I was sure that I would one day command a fleet of fishing vessels, just like my father before me. Ah, it was a foolish dream...
Hang about, I know what's wrong with him!<NL>He's just lacking a bit of <color:#1>ambition</color>, that's all!
He doesn't think he'll make anything of himself as a fisherman, so he's thinking of chucking it all in!<NL>There's tragic!
Righto, Ollie-boy! Let's go and land ourselves<NL>some <color:#1>ambition</color>!
Are you really going to let him throw it all away, Ollie-boy!?
Ach... Why on earth did I choose this accursed profession...
But you just got your own boat and everything...!
Go on, Ollie-boy! Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and serve him up the <color:#1>ambition</color> he needs to get back in that boat of his!
Hmmm...!? Oh!<NL>What nonsense I allowed to pass my lips!
There is no reason why I should not have a fleet to equal my father's! My childhood faith was not unfounded!
Ha ha! Looks like someone's got his dream back!
Indeed I have, and you are the ones I must thank.
Please, accept this simple gift. It is a token of my gratitude.
Now, don't overdo it, will you?<NL>We've still got a lot of work ahead of us...
You mean to tell me you STILL haven't found us a location for the shop? Oh, for crying out loud! You're useless! Absolutely useless!
H-Hey...! What are you talking to me like that for?
Hmph! If I have to put up with you day in, day out,<NL>I'll talk to you however I want!
Whoa... That was kinda mean...
Proper vicious, Ollie-boy.<NL>She doesn't look the type either, does she?
What are you two looking at!? This is between me and my worthless lump of a husband!
D-Dearest, please! I think something's happened to you... You're... You're not yourself...
Ohhh yeah! Of course, mun!<NL>She's brokenhearted, en't it!?
Really?
Not a single doubt about it! Suffering from a severe lack of <color:#1>kindness</color> she is—mark my words!
She's going to do that husband of hers a real mischief if we don't help her...
All right! Let's fix her broken heart!
That's the spirit!<NL>Remember, it's <color:#1>kindness</color> she needs, en't it!
Reckon he's man enough to take it, do you, Ollie-boy?<NL>I en't so sure myself, like...
Brokenhearted, this one is, Ollie-boy. No doubt about it. Lacking <color:#1>kindness</color>, en't it?
You know what to do, don't you? Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and fill up that <color:#1>kindness</color>-shaped hole in her soul!
Wh-What's going on...!?<NL>My heart, it feels really...clear, somehow...
...Oh! Oh, darling, I'm so sorry!<NL>I don't know what I was thinking!<NL>I can't believe the things I said to you!
It's fine! Absolutely fine!<NL>I've got the old you back, and that's all that matters!
Thank you, young man! I don't know what would have become of us without you. Please, take this!
You're useless! Absolutely useless!
Hadn't we better be getting ready to move on, dear?
Have I done something to make her angry...?
I mean, I know I'm not a perfect husband or anything...
Thanks again! I've never seen my wife get angry like that before. I just didn't know what to do...
Don't worry, dear! I need to keep myself in top condition for when we eventually open our shop!
Hmm... Perhaps she is now awake...
Hmm... What should I prepare for her tonight, I wonder...
Are you cooking dinner, Miss?
Indeed I am. There is an old lady who lives alone near here, you see. I assist her with domestic tasks and so on.
So you're her maid, huh?
Ho ho! Oh no, nothing like that.<NL>It is merely something that I choose to do.
The old lady, she cared for me when I was a child. I am merely repaying the very many favors she performed for me.
There en't a lot of people who'd do that kind of thing without asking for a single guilder in return, you know...
This one's got more <color:#1>kindness</color> in her little finger than most folks have got in their whole body.
Uh... Excuse me, Miss? We were wondering if you'd be able to help us with something...
Hmm? You require my assistance?
That's right! We were hoping you'd be able to share a little bit of your kindness with us. There's somebody who needs it, you see...
Hmm... If it will help someone who is in need, how could I possibly refuse!
Thank you very much, Miss!
The thought that I might help someone gives me the greatest satisfaction!
I am merely repaying that old lady for the kindness she showed me, nothing more. Now, what shall I make for dinner tonight...?
She's got a heart full of <color:#1>kindness</color>, this one! We should ask if we could borrow some of it!
Uh... I know this is a bit sudden...
But we'd like to borrow some of your kindness!<NL>There's somebody who needs it, you see...
Hmm... If there is someone in need of my assistance, of course I will help!
Thank you very much, Miss!<NL>Please just, uh, stay still for a little while...
Now, what shall I make for dinner tonight...?
What wonderful weather! A sign from the Ancients that I am due a bountiful haul, perhaps!
So you're a fisherman, huh?
I most certainly am! And I am just about to head out to sea!
En't you a bit worried about all the monsters that have popped up round here, then?
Monsters? Ha! No fisherman worthy of the name would give such trifling concerns a moment's thought!
You're...not scared of monsters?
Of course not! Why, I have already survived one monster attack! I drove those creatures away then, and if necessary I shall do the very same thing again!
Flipping heck, mun! You can almost smell the <color:#1>courage</color> on this one!
You sure can.<NL>Excuse me, Sir—we'd like to ask you a favor...
A favor? But I must set sail soon—lest I miss the fair winds, and the bountiful hauls they bring!
Oh, it'll only take a second!<NL>We just want to borrow a little of your courage!
My courage? Certainly! It is not something I lack.<NL>Take as much as you wish!
Thank you, Mr. Fisherman, Sir!
Oh? You are finished already? That, ah...tingling sensation in my chest... That was my heart, perhaps?
Men of the sea do not fear monsters!<NL>It is the monsters that should fear us!
You're pretty brave, huh! Say, would you mind sharing a little of your <color:#1>courage</color> with us?
Sharing courage? I do not understand you...<NL>Also, I must go fishing soon...
It'll only take a second, Sir! Please!
Well, in that case...<NL>Take as much as you wish!
Today also, I feel there is a bountiful haul in store for me!
Hmm... Today I shall swim, perhaps.
Nghh... It...hurts...me...NOT!
Are you all right?
Oh, yes. I am fine. I tripped over the decking, grazing my knee... But it hurts me not!
You sure about that, mun?<NL>Looks pretty flipping painful to me...
Yeah, it looks pretty bad!<NL>Most kids would be crying their eyes out right now!
Then perhaps I am unlike most children. Father told me that boys do not cry, and so I promised him that I<NL>never would.
So you're holding it all in, huh?<NL>To keep your promise, I mean.
I tell you what, Ollie-boy, this lad's heart is brimming with <color:#1>restraint</color>. Look at youer Locket, all aglow!
Gee, you're right!<NL>Say, uh, would you mind helping us out with something?
You require my help?<NL>Certainly, yes... But what do you wish me to do?
Oh, you don't have to do anything. We just want to borrow some of your restraint.
My restraint? I do not understand completely...<NL>But it sounds fun, I suppose. Please, go ahead!
Thanks! This will really help us out!
You know... My knee feels better, I think. Perhaps it was that spell you cast...
I am a boy, and boys do not cry! I promised my father! No matter how hard I fall, I WILL NOT CRY!
Ha ha! Now that's what I call <color:#1>restraint</color>!<NL>Would you mind lending us a bit, my lad?
Lending...you?<NL>I do not understand completely...
Uh, I know it sounds a little strange, but we'd like to borrow some of your restraint to help somebody who doesn't have any...
My restraint? I still do not quite comprehend...<NL>But it sounds fun, I suppose. Go ahead!
Oh! Did you see it!? The fish that just swam beneath the deck... It was enormous!
Father... What is a long-sleeved shirt?
Ah, bliss...
Oh. Oh my...
Is everything all right, Sir?
Oh! You have come to listen to my woes, perhaps?
Uh... Sure, I guess. I'd be happy to listen.
Well, believe it or not, the broken man you see before you is engaged to marry!
My betrothed possesses beauty and kindness beyond imagining. Her mind, it is most sharp! Her clothing, it is...immaculate...
Uh...
She sounds too good to be true, mun.<NL>What's he so blinking miserable about, then?
O-Oh! Please, forgive me. I should not be boasting about my future wife! I have much graver concerns, after all...
You see, my beloved has been treating me with a certain...indifference of late.
Oh! The anguish—nothing could pain me more!<NL>My love for her is all-consuming! The very thought that it is not fully reciprocated...!
...I don't think you need me to tell you that this fellow's got a bit of a <color:#1>love</color> surplus, Ollie-boy...
Yeah... I guess he must have...
Excuse me, Sir? Would you mind if we borrowed a little of your love?
We might be able to use it to help your fiancée remember how she felt before.
Really!? Oh, that would be...!<NL>Please! Take whatever you need!<NL>
Okay. Just stand still for a little while...
Oh...! What a curious warm sensation...
D-Does this mean...? Has she returned to her old self? Does she love me once more, perhaps!?
Uh... Well, she will do, I guess, but—
Oh, thank the Ancients!<NL>I must go and see her immediately!
What has happened to my betrothed!? She has become so cold! And yet my love for her is all-consuming! The very thought that it is not fully reciprocated...
I shall soon be meeting my betrothed.<NL>I can barely contain myself!
(sigh) I wish I could grow up more quickly, I truly do!
Ahoy! I am sure pirates interest you, do they not?
Uh...pirates?
Yes! Once I grow up, I shall become a great pirate captain! You could even join my crew, perhaps!
Uh... I'm sorry... It's real nice of you to ask and all, but...I just don't think I'm cut out for pirating...
Arrr. That is a shame, I think. You have the look of a good first mate...
So you really want to be a pirate captain when you grow up, huh?
Arrr! But not an ordinary pirate captain!<NL>I shall be the greatest pirate in all the world!<NL>I shall become King of the Pirates!
Imagine, setting sail with a crew of close friends, tracking down the hidden treasure... I do not think there could be anything better!
I bet his parents are pleased about his piratical ambitions! "What did you do today, son? Bit of pillaging, was it? There's lovely!" Flipping heck, I—
Not now, Mr. Drippy! Just look at him!<NL>I'll bet he has a whole heap of <color:#1>ambition</color>!
Ambition? What do you mean?
Oh! Uh... It's nothing. Don't worry.
So...when you say you want to be a pirate, do you mean one of the bad ones? The ones that steal things and hurt people?
Of course I do not mean that!<NL>I intend to be a pirate of justice!
Oh! Well, that sure is good to hear!
So, anyway, we were wondering if you could maybe help us out with something... It's for a good cause.
Gladly, I shall assist you! No doubt it will be fine practice for when I become the Pirate King of Justice!
Ha ha! I guess it will!<NL>Thanks, future Pirate King of Justice!
Arrr! That felt nice and warm!
You are a very nice boy. And very talented, also...<NL>Are you sure you will not join my crew?
Oh! Uh... Can I think about it?
You will consider it?<NL>Wonderful! The high seas await!
When I grow up, I shall become King of the Pirates, and set sail with my closest companions in search of hidden treasures...
So, uh... We'd really appreciate your help with something. It's for a good cause.
If you ever wish to sail in the name of piratical justice, do let me know! Arrr!
The role of the designer is not to "go" with the fashion "flow." It is to create new trends, and thus shape the future of society!
Yes... YES!<NL>This is it... This is the future!
Gee, Ma'am! You sure do seem happy!
No doubt I do! I have successfully visualized a swimsuit more elegant than anything that has come before it! For the designer, no joy is comparable!
I need only acquire the materials, and my vision shall be realized... Ah! Perhaps you can help!
Uh... Us? Really?
Yes! YES! Would you do something for me, perhaps? In the name of the Ancients and all that is elegant?
My new swimsuit design requires a certain material that is...rare, but by no means unobtainable. I wonder if you could fetch it for me, perhaps?
Oh, thank you! It is <color:#1>rainbow leaves</color> that I require—these are usually carried by <color:#1>florets</color>. <color:#1>Three</color> should suffice, I think.
Uh... What's a floret?
Keep up, Ollie-boy! They're creatures that roam the Shimmering Sands, en't they? You must have seen a couple. The thing is with rainbow leaves, though—
AH! This fairy knows his fashion, I think!<NL>There is indeed an additional complication...
The rainbow leaves that florets carry must be <color:#1>cooled down</color> before you pick them up. They will otherwise wilt before your very eyes.
This makes life difficult, I realize, but the designer's lot has never been easy!
But...how are we meant to cool them down if the florets are holding them?
Hmm... Oh! What's that icy spell you've got again? <color:#8>Frostbite</color>, is it? Try knocking the florets out with that—should keep the leaves nice and cool, I reckon!
That sounds like a plan, Mr. Drippy!<NL>Let's give it a try!
Hmph. And I thought you understood what it meant to be a designer...
I am a designer. A swimsuit designer, no less.<NL>The very purest form of design, I think!
Castaway Cove is the swimsuit design capital of the world—the locals' insatiable appetite for the latest trends must be catered to!
Indeed, I have just visualized my latest masterpiece—a great success in the offing, I am sure!
The next step is to make it a reality, of course.<NL>But first I must acquire the necessary materials...
Ah! You would be willing to assist me, perhaps? I beseech you in the name of the Ancients and all that is elegant!
It is <color:#1>rainbow leaves</color> that I require—these are usually carried by <color:#1>florets</color>. <color:#1>Three</color> should suffice, I think.
Oh, and do remember to <color:#1>cool the leaves</color> before picking them up! They will otherwise wilt away to nothing!
I brought you those rainbow leaves you wanted!
Yes! YES! These are perfect, I think! You have done the world of fashion a great service, young man!
So...you can make that swimsuit now?
I can! Most certainly, I can! You are hereby witnessing the birth of a new and exceedingly important trend!
Your role in its realization shall not be forgotten, of course. Please, accept this token of gratitude. And do not forget me when you have need of a designer!
Have you acquired the rainbow leaves I requested?
Oh. You have only one, I see... Naturally, the designer cannot make such compromises. I MUST have <color:#1>two more</color>!
Oh! Already you have two!<NL>Just <color:#1>one more</color>, and my vision can become a reality!
I simply cannot wait to witness the cultural impact of my latest designs!
...!
Mr. Drippy... Is it just me, or does this crab look like it has something to say?
Er...let me see...<NL>...Nope! I reckon it's just you.
Gee... Are you sure? It looks so...chatty.<NL>What should we do?
Flipping heck, mun, youer s'posed to be the wizard!<NL>Get youer wand out and cast a <color:#1>spell</color>, en't it?
Whaaagh! What am I going to do!?
Jeepers! Y-You seem pretty shook up!<NL>What's the matter?
WHAAAGH!<NL>You can understand what I'm saying!?
What a stroke of luck!<NL>I was hoping someone like you would scuttle along. Would you mind helping me out with something?
Uh... What kind of something?
It's my friend—he was swept away by a huge wave a few days ago! Please, you have to find him! I'd look for him myself, but I'm too shell-shocked!
Well...do you know which direction he went in, at least?
Hmm... Good question... I think the tide must have carried him to the <color:#1>east</color>, but I couldn't tell you any more than that...
All right...
I just thought, with that ship of yours, you were the perfect people to go and look for him, you know...
I guess so... All right, Mr. Crab!<NL>We'll go find your friend for you!
Whaaagh! Cracking news!<NL>Thank you!
Oh. I'm really in a pinch here, you know...
Please, travelers! Help me!
Travelers? You mean us?<NL>What do you want us to do?
It's my friend—he was swept away by a huge wave! Please, you have to find him! I'd look for him myself, but I'm too shell-shocked!
The tide would have carried him to the <color:#1>east</color>.<NL>Please let me know if you find him!
We found your missing friend, Mr. Crab!
Really!? Did you bring him back?
Well, you see...
So he washed up on a desert island, did he...?
Still, it sounds like he's having a cracking time!
Well... Why don't you go pay him a visit?
A visit? Hmm...<NL>Yes! Perhaps I will! He did invite me, after all!
Listen, thank you ever so much for finding him. Please, take this. It's the least you deserve after going to all that trouble.
I've decided to pay my friend a visit! I hope he wasn't telling tall tales about how nice his new island is...
Mr. Drippy, don't you get the feeling that this crab is trying to tell us something?
Oh! How wonderful to see you again. You are looking for a designer to bring an element of elegance to your life, perhaps?
Actually, yes! We're looking for a <color:#1>snazzy swimsuit</color>.<NL>We thought maybe you would have one...
You thought correctly!<NL>...In theory, at least.
But alas, my very last snazzy swimsuit has been taken!
Oh, somebody bought it, huh?
Tragically not! It was, in fact, stolen by a most troublesome seagull! And one without an ounce of fashion sense, at that!
Jeepers! A seagull stole your swimsuit? Uh...you wouldn't happen to remember which direction it flew off in, would you?
I cannot be certain, for I was rather traumatized at the time, but...I feel it may have flown to the <color:#1>west</color>. Only the Ancients know where it might be now, however...
The west, huh? All right!<NL>Come on, Mr. Drippy!
Hang on a minute, mun!<NL>Don't you think we should get some more clues first...?
That seagull flew off to the <color:#1>west</color>, I am certain of it.
I must start coming up with some ideas for next season. A designer's work is never done!
Here you go, Sir!<NL>One tikka mahala curry!
Ah! Praise be to the Ancients, it has arrived!<NL>Ahhh! What wondrous aromas! My mouth, it waters...
The treacherous desert crossing one must make when visiting Al Mamoon fills me with the most terrible dread. This delivery service is truly a blessing!
That's good to hear!
Ah, but such an achievement as this most memorable of curries must be commended in person! Please inform Raj that I shall be braving the sands to visit him soon!
All right, we'll tell him!
During my last visit to Al Mamoon, I sampled the fabled "tikka mahala" curry. Truly, its flavor made a most lasting impression!
It would appear that Castaway Cove is in the grip of tikka mahala fever!
Arrr! You again!<NL>You have decided to join my crew, perhaps?
Uh... Not just yet...
No? How unfortunate.<NL>Especially so, considering my latest find...
Eh? What's that then? It's not...treasure, is it?<NL>
Harr harr! It is better than treasure!<NL>It is a genuine treasure map!
I happened to come across it while rearranging the governor's storeroom!
When I showed it to him, he appeared certain that it was once the property of the legendary "Castaway Corsairs"!
Wow! Are you sure it's real?
Most assuredly! And look—<color:#1>seven</color> places have been marked upon it...
They must be the locations of hidden treasure!<NL>Do you not think so?
I sure do! This is so neat! A real-life treasure map!
Arrr! I was sure you would be interested!<NL>A suitable find for the future Pirate King of Justice, I think!
Alas... Mother will not allow me to go and look for these treasures. It is "dangerous," she claims...
Of course it is, mun. There's flipping loads of monsters<NL>out there!
There's no way a midget like you would last five minutes. 'Course, being the Lord High Lord of the Fairies, I'd be fine, like...
Truly!? You will investigate the locations marked on this map for me?
Then please do so, I beg of you!<NL>The treasures must be found!
Harr harr! I felt sure you would agree...
Now, I am sure you wish to commence your search right away, but this map is not without its problems...
It is extremely old, you see, and it is torn in several places. Therefore, the exact locations of the treasures are not quite visible...
But since <color:#1>seven</color> locations have been marked, it can be assumed that there are <color:#1>seven</color> separate treasures, I think...
Looks like it, mun! I s'pose we'll just have to search for them, en't it!?
Well, the legend of the Castaway Corsairs is very famous, I think. Everyone in this town knows about it, most certainly.
Perhaps you should ask <color:#1>local people</color> if they have advice about where to commence your search?
That sounds like a great idea!<NL>Gee, isn't this exciting, Mr. Drippy?
No!? That is not the attitude of a loyal crew member...
Look! Look at this!<NL>A treasure map!
Most assuredly so! And look! <color:#1>Seven</color> places have been marked upon it. They must be the locations of hidden treasures. They simply must be!
Alas... Mother will not allow me to go and look for them. It is dangerous, she claims...
Please, I beg of you! Go in my place, and uncover<NL>the treasure!
Anything that you find, we shall split equally between us. The Pirate King of Justice does not tolerate selfishness!
Arrr! Did you uncover any hidden treasure?
Well... No. I guess the Castaway Corsairs must have gotten there before us...
What!? Surely not...
But there are locations you have yet to visit!<NL>Perhaps we shall be more fortunate in future!
Well? Did you find the pirate treasure!?
Sorry... We didn't find any treasure.<NL>It seems the Castaway Corsairs already took it all.
You see, your map doesn't show the places where the Castaway Corsairs hid their treasure...
It shows where they first found it, all those years ago.
Yeah, there's a big stone monument in all the places marked on the map, see, and each one tells the story of the treasure they found there...
Can it be?<NL>(sigh) I had been so looking forward to uncovering the pirate treasure...
That's not all, though! There was some other strange writing on the monuments as well.
Yeah. Two Nazcaän letters on each one, en't it?
Really!? It is some kind of clue, I am sure!
If the letters are put together in the right order, perhaps they reveal the location of the entire treasure hoard!
Crikey! There's clever!
Well, we wrote down all the Nazcaän we saw, so...
What!? Please, show me!<NL>Allow me to read what it says!
So the writing on the monuments says:<NL>[nz_1][nz_k], [nz_4][nz_l], [nz_7][nz_3], [nz_3][nz_b], [nz_6][nz_i], [nz_5][nz_a], [nz_2][nz_v]...
Flipping heck, I can't make head nor tail of that, mun!
Well, I guess we just have to decode it all...
Please, let me know when you have done so!<NL>I shall wait for you here!
Have you done it!? Have you decoded the writing on the monuments!?
Kublai Khan...the Third?
K-Kublai!?
Is he...known to you?
Sure he is. You must have heard of "Kublai, King of the Sky Pirates," right? I wonder if they're related...
I'd bet my bottom guilder on it, Ollie-boy! Cor, getting proper interesting, this is! I reckon we should pay old Kublai a visit—see what he makes of it!
Hmm. You do not appear to have successfully decoded it...
The writing on the monuments says:<NL>[nz_1][nz_k], [nz_4][nz_l], [nz_7][nz_3], [nz_3][nz_b], [nz_6][nz_i], [nz_5][nz_a], [nz_2][nz_v]...
Please, decode it as quickly as you can!
You are acquainted with the King of the Sky Pirates!? How wonderful!
Ah! You have finally returned!<NL>You have something to report, perhaps?
We sure do! Kublai Khan the Third was our friend Kublai's great-great-great-grandfather—and he was the captain of the Castaway Corsairs!
Arrr! I thought as much! Truly, I did!
So Kublai sent us off to find out what the old fellow left behind, see? The "greatest treasure of all," en't it?
Harr Haaarr! And? What did you find?<NL>You must tell me at once!
Well, it's probably not what you were expecting...
What? Surely not another puzzle!?
Nah, mun. It was old Kublai Khan's grave, en't it?
His...grave?
Uh-huh. But there was a message, too.
"...After all this time and all this traveling,<NL>I have discovered the greatest treasure of all:<NL>a life spent with friends."
Proper wise words from the old sea dog there, en't it?
Memories of good times with youer butties are way more precious than boring old treasure, like...
...Hold on, no they flipping en't!<NL>What a load of old rubbish!<NL>That pirate wants his head looking at!
I see. So there never was any treasure to be found...
But Kublai the Third's words have only made me more determined to have my own adventures—with friends,<NL>of course!
Gee, that's great!<NL>We'll be rooting for you—and your friends!
Arrr! Thank you! Though our search for treasure was not successful, the tales you brought back with you gave me untold pleasure!
In fact, please allow me to give you this—in exchange for all the excitement you have brought into my life!
Oh! And please, take these also! I found them in the governor's storeroom, near to the place where I discovered the map!
May they help you to manufacture the mightiest of weapons!
Arrr! The seven seas await!<NL>Weigh anchor!
You have heard of the legendary pirates who once ruled the seven seas, perhaps?
It is said that their lair was located here in Castaway Cove!
Uh, excuse me... Have you heard about the Castaway Corsairs?
Most naturally!<NL>There is no one in this town who has not, I am sure!
The tales of their adventures have been popular bedtime stories for generations!
Wow, really? Would you mind telling us one?
Well... There is the one about when they headed northwest in search of a treasure located on a <color:#1>tiny and intensely cold island</color>.
A location with a climate quite different to their native Castaway Cove—they say it was gripped by an eternal winter!
I have even heard versions of the tale that mention something called "snoh"—a soft, white substance that falls from the skies!
My word... A pirate monument on the island of Tiny Tim, you say!? Then that tale must have been grounded in truth...
Excuse me. We were wondering if you could tell us anything about the Castaway Corsairs...
Hm? Me?<NL>Ah... Surely, I am no expert...
But I do recall the tale of how they found treasure in the, um, <color:#1>Ba...</color> The <color:#1>Bar...</color>something. It was somewhere coastal.
I seem to remember the story saying that they returned in moods most foul, even though they had succeeded in finding the treasure they sought... Strange.
Ah! The Barrens, you say? Yes, that was the place! And the treasure was but a single coin? Dear me! It is little wonder they were most unhappy!
Excuse me, Ma'am. Do you know anything about the Castaway Corsairs? We heard there were all sorts of tales about them...
Ah, yes... These are old tales, indeed...<NL>I recall one about them finding treasure on an island covered in birds...
Now, what might it have been called? <color:#1>Swan Island</color>? <color:#1>Ugly Duckling Isle</color>? One of those, I am certain...
Ah, so it was Swan Island!<NL>But there were no birds there, you say?
...Well, such embellishments are the hallmark of such tales, I think! Ho ho!
Excuse me, Sir... Do you know anything about the gang of pirates who used to live in this town?
Ah! You mean the Castaway Corsairs, I think!<NL>As a child, nothing would excite me more than hearing tales of their adventures!
My favorite was always the one in which they went to <color:#1>Bungler's Bay</color>, west of here. Their captain nearly met his end there, I believe...
Oh... So that is how the captain nearly met his end...
Well, such fallibility serves only to enhance the appeal of the Castaway Corsairs, I think! For better or worse, they were true men!
Excuse me, Ma'am... Would you be able to tell us anything about the Castaway Corsairs? Anything at all...
Ah! It is the treasures they found that you wish to<NL>hear about, perhaps?
Well... Many people know of <color:#1>the Shipwreck Shore</color> and the reason for its ominous name...
But not so many know that the Castaway Corsairs once ran aground there themselves.
...Or so the legend goes.
Thanks, Ma'am!<NL>We'll go take a look!
Ah! You are back, I see! Did you find what you were seeking on the Shipwreck Shore, perhaps?
Excuse me, Sir. Do you know anything about the Castaway Corsairs? We're interested in learning as much about them as we can.
Oh ho! I am sure I know what you are interested in, young man! Treasure! Ha ha ha!
Very well. The continent of Autumnia is divided by a mountain range, in the foothills of which is a steep incline known as <color:#1>Billy Goat's Bluff</color>.
It is said that the Castaway Corsairs left the safety of their ships and scaled these hills in search of treasure!
Perhaps they rather fancied themselves as part-time mountain bandits! Ha ha!
Aha! You went to Billy Goat's Bluff, did you? An arduous journey, I am sure. One of tall waves and taller hills! A pirate's life is by no means easy! Ha ha!
Hi there! Do you know anything about the Castaway Corsairs?
Yes! Of course! Mother tells me one of their tales every night before I go to sleep!
Last night, she told me about when they went to an island that was far, far away...and found treasure there!
Neat! Do you maybe remember the name of the island?
Hmmm... It was...the <color:#1>Island of Mine</color>! No, that was not it. It was the <color:#1>Island of NOT Mine</color>! No, that is not right... <color:#1>No Island of Mine</color>, perhaps?
No Island of Mine, you say?<NL>Hold on, that name rings a bell...
Ah! You are back!<NL>Did you find any treasure?
You received some new alchemy formulae!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
Ah! That big pot you have...<NL>It is a cauldron, is it not?
Uh...yeah. That's right.
Hee hee! So you must be a wizard!
Crikey! It sounds like this little girl knows a thing or two about wizarding, Ollie-boy!
I do! I read my wizard book every day. I know all about wizards and the spells they cast!
But the spells, they are not my favorite thing about wizards. It is alchemy that I love the most!
I read that wizards can make almost anything by mixing materials in a cauldron! Is that true?
It sure is! It's actually pretty easy if you have the right ingredients!
Easy for one such as you, I think! Ahh, being a wizard must be very wonderful... Would you...? Would you show me how alchemy works?
You could make me a <color:#1>candle cutter</color>, perhaps?
I have heard that <color:#1>candle cutters</color> can only be made using alchemical methods! I would dearly love to see one<NL>for myself!
Oh, wonderful!<NL>I do not think I have ever been this excited!
Now, to make a candle cutter, you will need a <color:#1>flint dagger</color> and also an <color:#1>emberstone</color>!
Flipping heck! You don't half know youer stuff!
Hee hee! It is all in my book!<NL>All right, I shall wait for you here.<NL>Please hurry, I am very excited!
Hmph! Why not!?<NL>Perhaps you are not, in fact, a wizard!?
I do! I read my wizard book every day.<NL>And my most favorite part concerns alchemy!
A wizard like you must know how it is done, yes?
Show me, please! Show me how alchemy works! Would you perhaps create a <color:#1>candle cutter</color> for me?
To make a <color:#1>candle cutter</color>, you will need a <color:#1>flint dagger</color> and also an <color:#1>emberstone</color>!
I shall be waiting here.<NL>How exciting!
We're back! And we brought you a candle cutter!
Ohhh! Wonderful! Simply wonderful! Something so magnificent, created from such simple materials...<NL>I can hardly believe it!
Well, you'd better believe it! Wizards like Ollie-boy can do all sorts of amazing stuff!
Ah, I do love alchemy so.<NL>How I wish to become a wizard like you...
Oh! Perhaps I should give you something to thank you for showing me the candle cutter! Please, take this!
There are all sorts of formulae in my wizard book.<NL>I can teach you some of them, perhaps?
When I grow up, I shall be a wizard as well!
Is it true? Can wizards use their cauldron to create objects that have never been seen before?
Oh, how wonderful!<NL>I do wish I could become a wizard!
Oh! Hello again, Sir!<NL>So you made it back to the Summerlands, huh?
I most certainly did! Had a hankering to visit Ding Dong Dell once more before calling time on this journey of mine. Bout of the old nostalgia, what!
Uh...yeah. So, did you find any interesting stuff to write about since we last saw you?
Well, I'm jolly glad you asked, old boy!<NL>There was one rather hairy moment when my ship got caught in the most frightfully nasty storm...
When we finally made land, I do declare I thought I'd discovered a new continent. You can imagine my excitement, I'm sure...
Strange plants, mysterious statues...and the queerest illustrations all over the ground... Why, the mere thought of it sets the old heart beating...
It's all documented in my diary, of course. I don't suppose you'd care to— Oh! Oh dear. Oh dear me...
No prizes for guessing what's coming next...
I've lost it! I've lost the bally thing!<NL>My diary! It's gone!
Well, well, mun. Who'd have flipping thought...?
I must have left the confounded thing on that island... Ahem. I don't suppose you'd help a chap out and fetch it for me, would you?
You would!? Oh, jolly good show! I wouldn't want to have to rely on this dicky memory of mine when the time comes to write the old memoirs!
So... Where exactly did you leave it? On some island, right?
Statues and drawings on the ground, is it?<NL>Hmm, I can think of a couple of places...
Don't s'pose you remember anything else, do you?
Hmm... Oh! I do recall making a diary entry while sitting on a <color:#1>small statue</color>—giving the old back a break, you know.
Aha! It all comes flooding back! Yes, there was a picture of the most <color:#1>enormous skull</color> on the ground nearby. Rather ghastly, if you ask me...
A picture of a skull, huh?<NL>Okay, we'll go find it for you!
But I'm to give a recital at the village hall next month! That diary contains all my best material!
Oh! It sure is good to see you again, Sir! Did you find any interesting stuff to write about since we last saw you?
I most certainly did! A frightful storm caused my ship to be washed ashore on an island the likes of which I'd never seen before!
It's all documented in my diary, of course. I don't suppose you'd care to— Oh! Oh dear. I've only gone and lost the bally thing!
I do recall jotting down a little something while sitting on a <color:#1>small statue</color>...
There was a picture of the most <color:#1>enormous skull</color> on the ground nearby if memory serves. I suppose I must have dropped it there...
We found your diary, Sir!
Oh, spiffing! So you made it onto that singular old island, did you? Rather treacherous, what!
Yeah, I guess. Try not to lose your diary again, okay?
Indeed not, old bean. This thing's given me enough scares as it is! Now, I simply must give you some sort of reward... Ah! Here you are!
That island really was dashed queer, you know...<NL>The very thought of it gets the old heart racing!
I say, this is the climate for me!<NL>I've half a mind to loosen the old tie!
Looks like we've patched up the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
We'd best let him know, en't it?
Looks like we've patched up all the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
That'll be the end of it then, I s'pose.<NL>We'd best let him know, en't it?
Fresh fruits! Vibrant vegetables!<NL>The very finest in the Summerlands!
Gee, they sure do look delicious!
Indeed they are! Only a bustling port town is blessed with fresh produce every day, I think!
...Now, I mean no disrespect, but...are you feeling quite well? You look pale and...a little gaunt. You are taking regular meals, I hope?
Perhaps I should give you some fresh fruits to help put a spring back in your step!
There's motherly! It's nice when someone spares a thought for youer well-being, en't it!?
Ah! I know what it is you require!<NL>Some recipes!
Simple recipes to provide you with a hearty meal after a punishing day on the road!
Be sure to take regular meals!<NL>Snacking is no good, I think.

Onward, to Castaway Cove!
Knickers! Stop, thief!
What are you doing, mun!? We've got to get after that dirty, stinking thief, en't it?
Where did that thief run off to? I'll catch him! No criminals escape justice on Inspector Drippy's watch!
Fish, cats and now a blooming great big pot! If you make me carry anything any heavier, I'll have to change my name to flipping Flatty!
Let's get this pot back to that peddler bloke before it breaks my flipping back, shall we?
Why do I always end up carrying flipping everything? What are you, too delicate or something? Too lazy, more like! Hmph! Kids these days...
Have a look through youer Wizard's Companion and find those magic words, en't it?
So it's for doing alchemy in, is it? That must be why it's so flipping heavy!
What's the matter with you? Don't want that massive great big pot or something? What are you, sensible?
Youer proper lucky getting youer hands on that cauldron, Ollie-boy. You can make all kinds of things now. Go on, make us a present!
If youer after a formula or two for youer cauldron, just chat to the odd person. You'll find someone with a recipe or two up their sleeves eventually.
Righto! All aboard the good ship Sageseeker!
Check out my swimmers, Ollie-boy! Pretty tidy, eh?
I can't believe they even had a swimsuit in my size! That village chief bloke must have a tidy pile of swimwear stashed away! There's prepared!
It's not a patch on mine, obviously, but youer swimsuit en't bad, Ollie-boy.
We need to get that Cowlipha of Al Mamoon to let us borrow her boat, en't it?
Fancy taking a look at the Cat's Cradle they've got over in Al Mamoon? I hear it's a proper snazzy one.
Let's get over to youer world, shall we?
There's a milk fountain over in Al Mamoon, en't there?
Shift it, mun! Let's get back to Al Mamoon!
We need to head over to Al Mamoon and find us some restraint, mun!
Don't you like Al Mamoon or something?<NL>We need to head back there, mun!
Let's go and give old Cowface her restraint back, shall we?
If we head down to Castaway Cove, we should be able to ride that boat now, en't it?
That's the weasel who stole the pot from that peddler! Come on, Ollie-boy, we've got to get that picture back!
What are you doing standing around chin-wagging, hm? There's thieves to catch, mun! Get to it!
Looks like we'll have to catch the beggar all over again. He's a proper bad penny, this one.
He's a proper pain in the neck, this bloke. Come on then, let's find some restraint before I lose some sympathy.
So he had a Nightmare, is it? That explains why he's been such a flipping nuisance, eh?
Did you see that thief bloke's eyes? Brokenhearted, he is. I'd put my life savings on it.
Come on, mun! We've got to help that thief bloke.
That village chief bloke has got more restraint than I've got good looks. And that's saying something, mun.
Can I go and change into my swimsuit? I flipping love my swimsuit!
That Swaine bloke may look scruffy as anything, but I reckon there's more to him than meets the eye. I can feel it in my lantern...
Ach, that Swaine's stubble is proper minging! I just want to yank it clean out of his face! Bleurgh!
What's he talking about? And what's he going to do with this chest, eh? I still don't quite trust this Swaine character...
That Swaine can probably steal us some tidy loot in the heat of battle, eh? There's useful...
At last, it's time to take to the ocean wave! Reckon they'll let me steer?
So only Swaine can get to these green chests, is it? Reckon I saw one back in Ding Dong Dell somewhere...
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
...Eh?<NL>Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.
We need to go and give those boys their pieces of art back, en't it.
S'pose we'd better go and make my mam laugh, eh?
Come on, mun! We need to get inside my mam, en't it?
We've got some unfinished business back inside my mam, mun!
We need to go and help those littlies!<NL>Pronto!
Come on, there's a slide in my mam's tum just waiting for us to go down it!
It's off to see the Empire, the wonderful Empire of Hamelin! In Autumnia!
Let's hurry up and get ouerselves to Hamelin, shall we?
D'you see any sages round by here?<NL>I flipping don't!
Reckon youer going to get some Hamelin armor round by here, do you? Well I flipping don't!
Oi, what do you think youer doing, ditching youer piggy armor and running off?
What exactly does this have to do with sneaking ouer way into the palace in Hamelin, hm?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?
We going back to the palace in Hamelin, or what, mun?
Let's get some belief off that Marcassin, shall we?
Come on, mun! Let's give Marcassin his belief back!
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
Itching to get over to Kublai's hideout, I am!
We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?
Let's hurry up and find that dragon's soul mate, shall we?
Motorville, mun! And make it snappy!
I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface? He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
Let's find that last stone shall we, mun?
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!
What do you reckon's going on with that soldier from Xanadu over in front of the palace in Hamelin, eh?
Time to take a trip on old Tengri, I reckon!
Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea to, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
There's lovely! Eh? The view, of course! I do like to be beside the seaside!
Eh? What's that? Sorry, mun, I was miles away! It's the sea does it to me, see? Soon as I see it I'm all at sea, see?
Fish, birds, crabs... It's a regular menagerie round by here!
Them trees over by there—them's mamangroves, en't they? There's tropical!
You should see my breaststroke, mun! Fantastic, it is! I was all-fairy champion five years running when I was a littlie!
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
You know, when all this is over, I'm going to miss—erm... Misbehave, mun! Go crazy, I will. Fairy rarebit for breakfast, babana flans all day long...
Flipping heck, mun! Proper wound up, I am!<NL>Come on, let's do something, before I go potty!
Let's start the new day as we mean to go on, shall we? Best foot forward, and last one in's a rotten egg!
You should have a read of youer Wizard's Companion once in a while, mun. It's the wizardly thing to do.
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
We need to go and give those boys their funny bits back, en't it.

......!<NL>............!
Hello, Oliver! Enjoying the snow?<NL>And what about the aurora? Amazing, isn't it?
It sure is! I never saw anything like it before!
But it's so flipping cold out there, mun! How the heck can you stand around gawping at the sky in that chill?
I don't feel the cold, do I, stupid? But I still ended up coming inside, I suppose...
'Course you did! It's cold enough to freeze youer ghoulies off out there, mun! Warm in here though, en't it? Funny, since it's made out of snow...
These igloos were built by the snow people—the tomte.
Some say that it's the warmth in the tomtes' hearts that keeps their igloos so cozy and warm.
Could be true, you know. I reckon them walking furpiles are almost as friendly as we fairies! Not quite, of course, but close...
You should try their ice stew—a bowl of that in the comfort of a nice, warm igloo is an experience you'll never forget!
Ice stew!?
Yes, it's a hearty stew with an icy bite!<NL>It's made from those flowers there.
What are they called again...?<NL>I can't seem to remember...
Let's make that your challenge for this time, shall we?<NL>Go on, tell me what <color:#1>the flowers in front of me</color><NL>are called!
They're definitely in the Wizard's Companion somewhere. Come and talk to me when you've found out.
Did you work out what <color:#1>the flowers in front of me</color><NL>are called?
You don't need to go and find any—just look them up in your Wizard's Companion.
Just flick through the pages of your Wizard's Companion until you find an item that looks like these flowers here. Easy-peasy!
Yes, that was it!<NL>That was what they were called!
Blizzard blooms grow all over this region.<NL>A lot of the creatures even carry them around.
Oh, I need to give you a new spell, don't I?<NL>How about something to help you in battle?
Neato! Thanks, Horace!<NL>I'm sure that'll come in real handy!
You'll probably use <color:#8>Cloudburst</color> more for its ability to nix all your enemies than for the damage it does.
It's perfect for wizards who don't like playing catch-the-fireball. You know—beginners! Heh heh.
Sounds right up youer street eh, Ollie-boy?
I tried to mix <color:#8>Frostbite</color> and <color:#8>Cloudburst</color> together once to see if I could make it snow...
Did it work?
...Sort of. Well...it was more like hail, really.<NL>Great big, razor-sharp hail.
......
Ahh, it's so nice to see the snow again...
It reminds me of something, though...<NL>I can't think what...
If only I could remember...
Don't fret, mun. Youer a ghost, en't it. Bound to be some memory loss involved in the enghoulment process.<NL>I'm sure it was nothing important.
I hope you're right...
Sorry, I got a bit distracted there. I think I'll go and climb a mountain or something to clear my head!
See you!
I love the snow, but it reminds me of something...sad.<NL>I think I might go and climb a mountain to<NL>clear my head.
I am knitting lovely gloves!<NL>Soon they will be finished!
Really? That's neat!<NL>Are they a gift for somebody?
Yes indeed they are!<NL>They are being for my grandmother!
Now that she is old, she is feeling the cold so very badly.
There's thoughtful of you!<NL>Youer granny'll be made up, love!
Hee hee! Before, I have made her a scarf.<NL>And before this, a hat!
You did? Gee, that's so nice of you!<NL>You do an awful lot of knitting, huh?
Yes. It is being somewhat hard work, but the smile of my grandmother is a very fine payment!
What a little sweetie! That's the kind of <color:#1>kindness</color> you only see once in a blue moon, en't it!
It sure is!
Excuse me, we have something to ask you.<NL>Do you mind?
Mind? No, I do not mind!
We could really use some of your kindness to help other people who need it. Would you mind sharing a little<NL>with us?
Share it? But I am not knowing how...
All I need you to do is hold still for a second.<NL>Can you do that for me?
I hope you are helping many people in need indeed!
Now that my grandmother is old, she is feeling the cold so very badly. I am knitting for her a pair of gloves. I hope they will make her smile.
Sure they will! Say, we have something to ask you.<NL>Do you mind?
We could really use some of your <color:#1>kindness</color> to help other people who need it. Would you mind sharing a little<NL>with us?
I hope to see the smile of my grandmother again very soon. It is being like the sunshine!
Friend, are you ever having been on a toboggan ride? Wheeeeee! It is being such fun to slide from a high place to a low!
Nnnghhh...<NL>This was being too high, perhaps...
Are you okay?<NL>How did you hurt yourself?
I am being fine. Thank you for your concern. It is just that I love so tobogganing.
But I am having tobogganed from a very high place this time. My balance was lost, and...
Maybe you shouldn't go so high next time.<NL>Your mom and dad must worry about you.
No no! Everything is being fine!<NL>I am not slightly frightened of such heights!
Just because you en't scared doesn't mean youer mam and dad en't though, does it?
Hey, Mr. Drippy! Do you think this boy maybe has more <color:#1>courage</color> than he needs?
Ahh, you think that's why he's taking such big risks, is it? Nice thinking, Ollie-boy.
Say, could we borrow some of your courage? Your bravery might be enough to help somebody who needs it.
Is this truly being a good idea?<NL>I am not becoming a cowardy coward?
It's okay. We only need to borrow a little.<NL>You won't notice a thing.
Truly...? Then please—take freely!
Thanks. Now, hold still for just one second...
Oh. This is being strange.<NL>I am feeling perhaps a little calmer now...
I love so tobogganing! It is being such fun to slide from a high place to a low, even if one is becoming injured!
It's okay. We only need to borrow a little. You won't notice a thing. Now, hold still for just one second...
Perhaps I am making my mamma and pappa in pain with worry. I will play in places with more safety from now!
This town is being a very, very nice town!
The people of this town are being very friendly!<NL>Very warm! We tomte are being very happy!
It sure is nice to see humans and tomtes living<NL>together, huh?
En't it, though! Cohabiting in peace and harmony, they are!
Yes, we are, yes! And never fighting!<NL>Always we are being friends!
There's beautiful! It's not often you hear a heartwarming tale of communities coming together like that, eh?
Look, Mr. Drippy!<NL>The Locket—it's glowing!
And I reckon I know why. Ouer tomte friend by here is overflowing with <color:#1>belief</color>, en't it?
Say, Mr. Tomte...<NL>Can I ask you something?
Asking of me?<NL>Yes, of course, please!
Would you share a little of your belief with us?
Yes, of course, yes! We are being friends, yes?<NL>Friends are sharing everything, yes?
Thank you very much!
This is being enough, yes?
It sure is!<NL>Thank you so much, Mr. Tomte!
We are all being friends together here, yes?
En't it lovely how everyone by here believes in each other? And this tomte's got more <color:#1>belief</color> than most!
Say, Mr. Tomte...<NL>Would you share a little of your belief with us?
My belief, yes?<NL>Yes, of course, yes!
If you ever are having trouble, please just be asking for help, yes? We are being your friends!
We people of Yule love so a delicious ice stew!<NL>To eat it together is our happiest time!
...Hm? Is it not making us terribly cold, you ask? The very contrary! My ice stew blows away all chills!
Ice stew? It sounds nice, but doesn't it make you<NL>kinda cold?
Ho ho ho! Silly child!<NL>The very contrary!
My ice stew blows away all chills!
Well, she en't lacking in culinary confidence,<NL>I'll give her that...
Hee hee! My ice stew is being the best in all of the town!
None better than I at its preparation exists!
You're right, Mr. Drippy. She's full of <color:#1>confidence</color>!
En't she just. Granny here's more cocksure than<NL>Cock Robin himself!
Excuse me, Ma'am...could we ask you a favor?
You wish to enjoy trying my unbeatable ice stew? Please! Eat all and more!
Um, well, it's not that, actually...
No? Such a shame...
Sorry to disappoint you, Grandma, but it's youer confidence we're after. Just a little bit of it, mind.
Please! Just a little!<NL>All you have to do is hold still for one moment!
Yes, yes, yes, child.<NL>Like this is being fine?
Yes, that's perfect!<NL>Thank you, Ma'am!
It is being finished already?<NL>Then you will come and try my ice stew! Come!
My ice stew is being the best in all of the town!<NL>None better than I at its preparation exists!
Crikey! Granny here's more cocksure than Cock Robin himself! Brimming with <color:#1>confidence</color>, she is!
Here, Missus, we couldn't have a lend of a bit of youer confidence, could we?
Ho ho ho! My ice stew is being enough to blow away<NL>all chills!
Awwwwww! So sweet!<NL>So fluffy fluffy fluffy!
You are making me blush, yes?
So fluffy fluffy fluffy!<NL>Almost too fluffy fluffy fluffy!<NL>You are thinking so also, yes?
He is, huh!<NL>He's real cute!
He is, he is, he is!<NL>I love my fluffy fluffy fluffy!<NL>There is being no other for me!
Jeepers, look at the Locket! I guess she really does have a lot of <color:#1>love</color> for her friend, huh?
Looks like it, eh?
Hey, would you let us have a little of the love you feel for your fluffy friend?
Yes, yes, yes! I am worrying that I love him too much! Please, you must take some!
Thanks! Just hold still for one moment...
Oooooohhh... This is feeling very strange...<NL>For what will you use my love?
We're going to use it to help people who don't have enough love themselves.
Truly? Will they also be becoming lovers of my fluffy fluffy fluffy?
Gee, I don't know...<NL>Uh, I mean, sure they will!
I love my fluffy fluffy fluffy!<NL>There is being no other for me!
I will be so happy if more people are loving my fluffy fluffy fluffy!
Hm? You ask am I finding it cold to be living here? Ha ha ha! Not slightly!
Brrrrrr... Such cold...<NL>I am hating so to go outdoors...
Husband!<NL>What are you saying!?
Is something the matter?
My husband has become suddenly afraid of going into<NL>the outside.
But wife! It is being so very icy!<NL>I might die of freezing!
What has become of the man who was once the strongest against cold in the village, hm?
Did he suddenly stop being able to stand the cold, Ma'am?
Exactly, he did. Before, there was not existing a day cold enough to stop him from venturing out.
I will not go into the outside!<NL>I will freeze to ice! Brrrrrr!
Mr. Drippy...he must be brokenhearted, huh?
Yep. Lost his <color:#1>restraint</color>, and can't bear the cold anymore, looks like. It's his pooer wife I feel sorry for, mind.<NL>We'd better help out, eh?
If we don't help, he'll never be able to leave home again! We have to do something!
Well, it's a simple enough procedure—find some <color:#1>restraint</color>, and hand it over. Reckon you can handle that, Ollie-boy?
S'pose there's loads of other people need helping too, eh? Let's come back later, shall we?
Husband! What are you saying!? What has become of the man who was once the strongest against cold in the village, hm?
He's lost his <color:#1>restraint</color>, and can't bear the cold anymore, looks like. It's his pooer wife I feel sorry for, mind.<NL>We'd better help out, eh?
Righto, Ollie-boy. You got some <color:#1>restraint</color> there, en't it. Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over, will you?
Hm? I am feeling suddenly warm! Why was I complaining so about coldness? Coldness is nothing to me!
Husband! You are being cured?<NL>You will go into the outside now?
Yes! Yes and yes!<NL>Forgive me for inflicting worry, wife!
I am to be thanking you for this, yes?<NL>Please be accepting of my thanks.
Into the outside, and back to work!<NL>I am being extremely ready to go!
I worry that you are being too strong against the cold, husband. Do not become frozen to ice!
Gah... What will I do?<NL>What has become wrong with him?
Until now, he was walking with a smile into the outside on even the coldest of days...
You are being back to yourself, husband.<NL>This is relieving...
I am having the kindest wife, and the most lovable boychild! Such a family!
Agh, you are being so bothersome... I must work. I have not the time to worry about you also...
What is having happened to you, husband?<NL>You are behaving so coldly...
Is something the matter, Ma'am?
Our beautiful boychild is having a fever, so I am thinking to go to the doctor.
But my husband is saying this is no fever at all and to not be bothering people.
Yes, yes, wife. I am doubting that this little boy will be caring much for your vexations. Go to home with you now.
How is this ever having been the man who once cared for his family so?
Hmph. You are tiring me...
Mr. Drippy—when somebody changes all of a sudden, that can only mean one thing, right?
That's right, Ollie-boy—brokenheartedness.
There en't a single drop of <color:#1>love</color> in that heart of his.<NL>Not a one.
Family is the most important thing there is!<NL>Mr. Drippy, we have to help them!
En't it, though! Let's give him back the <color:#1>love</color> he's lost, shall we? Come on, let's go and find some!
Ooh, there's cold, you are! What's the matter, Ollie-boy? You brokenhearted too or something?
What has happened to you, husband?<NL>Your boychild is having a fever!<NL>Why do you not care as before?
This is no fever at all. You must not be bothering people. Go to home with you now.
That's right, Ollie-boy. Brokenheartedness is the culprit here. There en't a drop of <color:#1>love</color> in that heart. Not a one.
It is no fever!<NL>Silence yourself, wife!
I have to cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and give him his <color:#1>love</color> back!
Nnngh... Hm? What am I...?
...Husband!<NL>Are you being...better?
...Yes. I am not knowing what happened to me.<NL>Forgive me, wife...
Wait! We must be taking our beautiful boychild towards the doctor with haste!
Looks like he's cured, huh?<NL>Thank goodness for that...
That he is! We couldn't let a family in need pass us by now, could we?
Thank you extremely! This is being only a trifle, but may it show some of my thanks.
Today too I must strive for the sake of my beloved family!
Brrr! Today is being even more frozen than most.
We must take care to watch that our beautiful boychild does not catch a cold.
What is having happened to you, husband?<NL>You are at most times so very warm...
Why suddenly have you grown so cold?
What relief...<NL>My fine, kind husband is back to me.
Brrr! It's so cold here!<NL>But the people are lovely.<NL>They've been so helpful.
We're not peddling our wares here.<NL>I've made up my mind. Come on, let's go!
What!? But we can't! If we do, all the stock we bought in Hamelin will go off...
Never mind that! How can we trust people who live with...things like these?
I'd rather some of our stock went rotten than have to stay here! Come on, we're leaving!
Flip, mun, are you two having another barney?<NL>It's like it's youer flipping hobby or something!
Mr. Drippy!<NL>You can't say things like that!
Oh, hello again!
You'll never guess what—my husband has had yet another funny turn! Please, you have to help him!
Let's see now... Yep, he's heartbroken again, and it looks like he's lacking <color:#1>belief</color> this time.
How do you two manage to get heartbroken so flipping often, eh?
This isn't the time to be scolding them, Mr. Drippy!<NL>We have to help them!
That's what I like to hear! Right, let's get ouerselves some <color:#1>belief</color> then, shall we?
Oi! I thought you said we needed to help them, you flipping flibbertigibbet, you!
Oh, hello again! You've come at just the right moment—my husband's had yet another funny turn! You have to help me!
Mr. Drippy! We have to help them!
How can we trust people who live with...things like these?
You got some <color:#1>belief</color> by there, en't it, Ollie-boy?<NL>Go on, then! Cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over!
...Oh. I feel...calmer, somehow.
Goodness... I can't believe I was so rude to the tomte after they were so kind to us... What an oaf I've been!
Are you better now, Sir?
You cured me again, didn't you? Thank you so much.<NL>I'd better go and apologize to everybody here in town...
Oh, but before that, here. To say thanks.
I'll go and apologize to everyone, and then let's get selling, shall we?
It really is freezing here.<NL>But it's also incredibly beautiful...
Oh, it's you. Hello again!<NL>You've come at just the right moment.
My husband's had yet another funny turn.<NL>Can you take a look at him for me?
Please! You have to help my husband!
Yes! Let's sell our hearts out!
I have heard a tale of the people of Castaway Cove. It says that they are wearing bathing suits and swimming in the sea!
Imagine such things! To swim in the seas of our home is entirely unpossible!
Ahh... It would be so very nice...<NL>One day perhaps I will go...
Go where, Ma'am?
I am being a lifelong resident of the Winter Isles.<NL>I am born here, and have never left.
I would like so very much to just once visit the lands of<NL>the south.
The bright sunshine, the deep, blue seas... And the dwellers of these lands are spending their days in bathing suits. Imagine such things!
It sounds like she'd really love to visit Castaway Cove, huh, Mr. Drippy?
Just a bit, mun! And she should—they had spare bathing suits for us, I'm sure they'd have one in her size...
Truly? You are thinking so?<NL>You have been to Castaway Cove?
I am being so very jealous of you!<NL>Do you have your bathing suits with you?<NL>Will you show them to me now?
Put ouer swimmers on!? In this cold!?<NL>Youer flipping joking, en't you?
No, you are misunderstanding me, I... I just wished to see one, as I...I wish to own a swimsuit of my own.
Please! Will you perhaps be making me the happiest girl in the world and bringing to me a <color:#1>snazzy swimsuit</color> from Castaway Cove?
I will absolutely be rewarding you finely!
Thank you so! Perhaps now soon I will be owning the swimsuit of my dreams!
There was a girl down in Castaway Cove who designed swimsuits, en't it? Let's go and ask her if she can help us out, shall we?
Sure! Let's go see her!
Oh, I cannot thank you!<NL>I look forward extremely!
N-No? Oh...
Ahh... It would be so very nice...<NL>One day perhaps I will wear one, too...
Wear what, Ma'am?
I am born here in the Winter Isles, and have never left.<NL>I am being very fascinated with the lands of the south.
I would rather nothing more than to own a <color:#1>snazzy swimsuit</color>. It is an item worn with high regard in<NL>those lands.
Will you perhaps be making me the happiest girl in the world and bringing to me one?
Remember—I am dreaming of a <color:#1>snazzy swimsuit</color> from Castaway Cove in the lands of the south!
Me and my! It is the real item!<NL>This is being really a snazzy swimsuit!
Is this the kind you wanted, Ma'am?<NL>Please, it's yours.
Hang on a sec. You en't going to put the thing on and try going for a swim round by here, are you?
Haha! It is not possible to be swimming nearby these parts, silly fairy!
...Well, I know that, don't I?<NL>It was a joke, mun! A flipping joke!
...Humorful. But now that you have brought my dream to me, I would like to one day try it in the sea.
Perhaps I will visit Castaway Cove for holidays...
Gee, that's a neat idea!<NL>You'll love it, Ma'am, I promise!
Hee hee! Thank you, boy! Here.<NL>This is to show my debt to you.
Yes, a holiday... To go to where I have not been would make a real adventure!
Ohhh! Today the sky is being very clear, yes?<NL>We will see the aurora greatly!
Boooy! Booooooy!<NL>Ohhh, where is he gone?
What's the matter?
It is my boychild, yes?<NL>He is suddenly disappeared.
Jeepers, that's awful!
Yes, it is, yes. One moment, he is playing with the small people, and then...
You will help me to seek him, yes?
Pretty thank you! He was playing with the small<NL>people, yes?
We should probably give the littlies round town a grilling then, eh?
You're right. Let's ask all the children if they've seen him.
Please very much!
Ohhh! Humans of the city are not being so kind!
Ohhh! My boychild! He is disappeared!
One moment, he is playing with the small people,<NL>and then...
My boychild was playing with the small people, yes?
Understood, Ma'am. We'll be sure to ask all the children in town if they know anything.
Ohhh! Th-The Glittering Grotto!?<NL>This is being terrible, yes?
There is being such danger that even large people<NL>do not approach!
Please very much—you must go to his help!
Pretty thank you! You brought my boychild home in safety, yes?
Ohhh! I cannot be grateful enough!<NL>Pretty, pretty, pretty thank you!
We're just glad he's safe, Ma'am.
Yeah, and at least now he knows to listen when his mam tells him not to do something. En't it, littlie?
Yes, I will listen, yes.<NL>Sorry to you, mother.
You must not be making me worried again, yes?
Ohhh! I am forgetting! It is a nothing, but I must be rewarding you, yes?
Pretty thank you for bringing the safety of my boychild!
I will never be making my mother to worry once more!
Hmm...<NL>I hope so that he is not being harmed...
Excuse me, but there's a little tomte boy missing.<NL>You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Eek!
"Eek," you say? Well, I think we all know what that means. Come on, lad, spit it out...
I have nothing to spit! It was not me!<NL>He is having gone himself!
Why don't you calm down a little and explain?
We are having been together to the mouth of the Glittering Grotto to try our bravery.
We are being told to not go there because of the wild creatures and danger...
Oh, and you think youer mams and dads tell you that for their own good, is it? If they say it's dangerous, it's because it's proper deadly!
S-Sorry to you...
So what happened to your friend?
Th-The voice of a beast came from within the cave, and I ran home with fear!
But he...he is having gone inside.<NL>He would not stop!
...He must have gotten lost somewhere inside, huh?
Well, we can't have that, can we? We'd best go and rescue the pooer dab before he gets eaten!
He would not stop! He is having gone inside the Glittering Grotto alone!
My cold compresses are being the best remedy for the pain of the lower back, yes?
Mmm? You are wishing to speak with me, boy?
Yes, Sir. I have something to ask you.<NL>Could we have one of your <color:#1>cold compresses</color>?
Ohhh! A <color:#1>cold compress</color>? You are knowing very well about me, yes?
Where upon your person is hurting, please?
Uh, no...it's not for me. It's for somebody in Perdida.<NL>His back is really hurting.
Ohhh! I am knowing him well!<NL>We are communicating through the peddler, yes?
Yes! So, will you let us have a compress?
Yes, of course, yes. But it is taking a little time to be making them.
That's no problem, Sir.<NL>We'll just wait right here.
Perhaps you will be listening to my request in return, yes?
Sure. What is it?
<color:#1>Manglerfishes</color> have been causing much trouble around the region of Yule, yes?
Can you please be defeating <color:#1>five</color> of them for me, please very much?
Five, huh? Sure we can!
They are fearing fire, yes? To defeat them with the <color:#1>blazing blade</color> the peddler is selling will make them not to come back soon.
You must be defeating the <color:#1>manglerfishes</color> around our town of Yule, yes?
Hmmm. The trouble of the manglerfishes is not yet finished, yes? You must defeat for me another <color:#1><quest_exb009:qs0023></color> of<NL>them, please.
We did it, Sir!
Ohhh! You are having defeated them, yes?<NL>And my cold compress is being finished.
Here to you. And please be greeting my friend of Perdida, thank you.
Please be delivering the cold compress to my friend of Perdida, yes?
Oh, you're here at last. I was beginning to think my predictions were incorrect. They weren't, of course...
Huh!? You mean you've been waiting out here in the cold for us?
I think you'll find it was with good reason. I need you to help me with some more of my research.
Flip, mun, does it never flipping stop with you?
Ha! I think you'll find that's exactly what I predicted you would say!
Which creatures do you need us to tame for you this time, Derwin?
I need you to bring me three examples of how the climate of the Winter Isles affects the physiological development of indigenous creatures.
The first <color:#1>travels atop a blue flower</color>, the second is <color:#1>a proud creature that has found its niche in the Glittering Grotto</color>, and the third <color:#1>piles snow upon its head</color>.
That sounds like a real interesting bunch of creatures, Derwin!
Did you expect my studies to focus on uninteresting creatures? I think you'll find the Winter Isles are replete with a myriad of frankly fascinating life-forms.
I hope you'll embrace this opportunity to further the cause of science yet again. Don't let me down.
Oh, and I cannot study them if you send them to<NL>the Familiar Retreat, so please don't waste my<NL>time by doing so.
Run along, then. Bring all three back to me, and I'll be sure to acknowledge your contribution in my next fascinating paper.
Um, I think you'll find you were supposed to agree to help further the cause of science...
Excellent. Oh, yes. Just look at that...
My, my... Well now, that is unexpected... Hmm, I have, of course, observed this phenomenon before...
I think you'll find this is very intriguing indeed...
This could well cement my standing at the top of the familiarological fraternity once and for all! I'm getting rather excited, you know...
Don't get too carried away, Derwin! It's cold out here—you might get sick if you stay outside too long...
He's right, you know. You won't be much good to the familiarological fraternity frozen into a block of ice,<NL>will you?
Ha! I think you'll find it will take a little more than<NL>sub-zero temperatures to deter a dedicated<NL>researcher such as myself!
What's the flipping point, mun...<NL>He never listens to a word we flipping say...
Oh. Here.
Now, where's the other one? <color:#1>The one with the snow piled on its head</color>? Science waits for no man, you know!
Now, where's the other one? The one that <color:#1>rides atop the blue flower</color>? Science waits for no man, you know!
Now, where's the other one? The <color:#1>proud creature that has found its niche in the Glittering Grotto</color>? Science waits for no man, you know!
I think you'll find I still need <color:#1>the proud creature that has found its niche in the Glittering Grotto</color>, and <color:#1>the one with snow piled on its head</color>.
Just two more. It shouldn't be too hard, even for you.
I think you'll find I still need <color:#1>the creature that rides atop a blue flower</color>, and <color:#1>the one with snow piled on its head</color>.
I think you'll find I still need the <color:#1>creature that rides atop a blue flower</color>, and <color:#1>the proud one that has found its niche in the Glittering Grotto</color>.
This time, I think I'll need you to find...
A creature that <color:#1>travels atop a blue flower</color>, <color:#1>a proud creature that has found its niche in the Glittering Grotto</color>, and one that <color:#1>piles snow upon its head</color>.
Don't go getting frozen solid searching for them—I have neither the time nor the resources to mount a rescue operation.
The data I have gathered will revolutionize the field of familiarology. You'll assist me next time as well, of course.
I think you'll find it will take more than sub-zero temperatures to halt the march of science!
Well, well, well! Fancy meeting you here, old stick! Jolly chilly round these parts, what!
You again!? Youer like the proverbial bad penny, you are! How did you end up by here?
Ho ho ho! Come now, dear boy, there's no need to take that tone! One simply enjoys a spot of the old peregrination is all!
And once one's diary has been published, the whole world will know just what's so bally marvelous about roaming the land!
The diary you keep losing every five minutes, you mean?
Oh, come now! Let's let sleeping dogs lie, shall we? I've jolly well learned my lesson! Why look, it’s just...um...just...oh...let me see now...uh...
.........bother.
Do you really need to flipping ask?
I really am most dreadfully sorry. I rather seem to have mislaid it yet again.
Of course you flipping have! Learned youer lesson, indeed! ...Well? Shall we come to the aid of the flipping party once more, Ollie-boy?
Where did you lose it this time, Sir?
Well now, let me see... One rather had one's breath taken away by the cold when we landed here... In fact, one was knocked spark out by it.
You were?<NL>Jeepers! I'm glad you're okay!
Rather, what! Had the dashedest stroke of luck, in fact. Some forest folk came across one's prostrate form.
When I came to, I was propped against a noggin of moss in a <color:#1>sparkling sylvan glade</color>. Somewhere <color:#1>west</color> of here, I seem to recall...
Perhaps the old diary's still there. Could have fallen out of a pocket, what?
<color:#1>A forest glade west of Yule</color>, huh?<NL>We're on it!
Oh. Oh, dear. That rather leaves one in a pickle, doesn't it?
Good day to you! Jolly nice to see you again, old stick! This traveling lark really is too much fun, what!
.........bother. I really am most dreadfully sorry. I rather seem to have mislaid it yet again.
Having been hit for six by the cold, I awoke to find myself in a <color:#1>sparkling sylvan glade</color>, somewhere <color:#1>west</color> of here. I daresay the old diary's still there.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Sir!<NL>We found your diary again!
Dear boy, you are absolutely and most positively the finest of fellows this side of Saintsbury in the hallowed county of Brickshire!
You have to take better care of your diary, Sir!<NL>It has all the memories of your journey inside!
Not to mention being one's magnum opus, what! Yes, I really should take better care of it... Oh! Do forgive my atrocious manners—for you, old thing!
Ahh, the bracing sensation of unfamiliar air in one's lungs really is the ticket, what! The heady intoxicant of the seasoned traveler!
Although I rather think the air round these parts is a little too cold for comfort...
One arrived on a little ship, you know. We bumped into something of an iceberg at one point. Jolly frightening stuff, what!
Looks like we've patched up the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
We'd best let him know, en't it?
Looks like we've patched up all the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
That'll be the end of it then, I s'pose.<NL>We'd best let him know, en't it?
Ohhh! I see you are having a cauldron.<NL>You are performing the alchemy, yes?
Yes, but...how do you know what a cauldron is,<NL>Mr. Tomte?
My grandfather was having one, too, yes? I am not performing the alchemy myself, but I am having seen him do it many times.
A strange man was appearing out of his cauldron.<NL>A very, very strange man...
You mean a genie, huh?
Yes, I do, yes. I wished also to be performing alchemy, but I have not the power of magic.
Even if you had, you'd have needed to convince the genie to work with you, too. And that, my furry friend, en't flipping easy.
Ohhh, is this being so?<NL>I was not knowing this...
My grandfather taught to me his recipes.<NL>You will be wishing to know them, yes?<NL>Here to you!
You received some new alchemy formulae!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
You are being a wizard, yes?<NL>Please have success in performing alchemy!
Welcome to one of the Cat's Cradle chain of purremium inns! We purride ourselves on our purracticality and purricing!
Your custom is always apurreciated!<NL>Have a nice nap!
Your custom is always apurreciated!<NL>I hope it wasn't too cold out there for you.
You'll find that it's purrfectly warm and cozy inside the igloos here. The tomte really are supurrb craftsmen.
Look, mun—youer Wizard's Companion's got a couple of new pages in it!
These tomtes just love being nice to people, en't it.<NL>I reckon this must be their doing, too.
I trust you had another purrfect night's sleep at the Cat's Cradle? Travel safely now!
And remember...<NL>Your next nap need never be far away!
Welcome to Swift Solutions, where those in need come to watch their worries fly away!
People with more troubles than they can swallow will place notices on the <color:#1>Errand Board</color> over there. Check it regularly to see if you can help out.
Welcome to you!<NL>Please very much!
Pretty thank you!
Not all tomte are speaking well the language of the humans, but somehow it is not mattering greatly.
Though they can be heard to be making only strange noises, their meanings can be known to all who listen, because they are speaking with the heart.
Beyond here is being the Glittering Grotto, to which children are not being let to go because of many dangerous creatures.
Our town is being very pretty, yes?<NL>So pretty as to forget the cold!
The tomte are said to be being souls of those who are having been swallowed by the snows.
After making a long hibernation, they are becoming tomte and returning to us here.
Their power to control the snows is keeping us safe from storms and blizzards.
Ha ha! Ner ner-ner ner-nerrr ner!<NL>Mine is being bigger than yooours!
I love so to walk through the snow!<NL>It is making a crunchy-scrunchy sound!
Ohhh! ...B-But mine is being prettier than yours!
So very, very pretty!<NL>So fluffy fluffy!
You are being a traveler, yes?<NL>You must be very cold, must you not?
If you are not being careful, you will catch the cold.
I have lately been suffering much back pain.<NL>I must ask of it to my tomte friend.
...Hm? Is it not making us terribly cold, you ask? Ho ho ho! The very contrary! It blows away all chills!
To see the small humans and the small tomte playing together in the snow...
Ahh, it is warming my heart.
Welcome to you to Yule, town of snows. We hope you are enjoying your time and not being too cold!
Do not fear the large white furry creatures you see around this place—they are being our friends and brothers.
Oooom mmmmn oooong?<NL>(Hello to you! Can I be helping you with something?)
(Mmmm mmm oooom...?)<NL>Can I make for you a cold compress?
Ooom mmmmmmn!<NL>(I must today also patrol the town!)
Ooom mmmmmmmng...<NL>(Perhaps I also will create a snowman...)
Mmm ooom!<NL>(I am blushing!)
Ooon mmmn oooong!<NL>(Strolling, strolling, patrolling, patrolling!)
Mmmmmmmm?<NL>(Both are being very pretty, yes?)
We need to set sail in search of Autumnia, mun!
Eh? What the heck is going on, mun?
...Eh?<NL>Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Heading back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Do we have to?
Back to the Fairyground, is it?<NL>...Ohh, knickers.
We need to go and give those boys their funny bits back, en't it.
S'pose we'd better go and make my mam laugh, eh?

It's off to see the Empire, the wonderful Empire of Hamelin! In Autumnia!
Let's hurry up and get ouerselves to Hamelin, shall we?

Reckon youer going to get some Hamelin armor round by here, do you? Well I flipping don't!
Oi, what do you think youer doing, ditching youer piggy armor and running off?
What exactly does this have to do with sneaking ouer way into the palace in Hamelin, hm?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?
We going back to the palace in Hamelin, or what, mun?
Let's get some belief off that Marcassin, shall we?
Come on, mun! Let's give Marcassin his belief back!
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
Itching to get over to Kublai's hideout, I am!
We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?
Let's hurry up and find that dragon's soul mate, shall we?
Motorville, mun! And make it snappy!
I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface? He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
It's no good! It's too flipping cold! I've got to go, mun! I'm busting!
I'm so flipping c-c-c-cold, I can't flipping w-w-w-walk straight!
At least you lot have got a few layers on, mun! My one-piece may compliment my figure, but it's not designed for the cold! Freezing, I am! Brr!
'Ning to you! I am being Drippy, Lord High Lord of the Fairies! What d'you reckon? Not a bad impression, eh? Heh heh.
The village elder's in a meeting, is it? I hope it's a meeting about installing some flipping heating!
I can't go out there again dressed like this, mun! I'll freeze my flipping bits off!
He must be back from his meeting by now, eh? Let's go and see the village elder, shall we, Ollie-boy?
'Ning to you! It is the time for us to be going now! Practically a flipping tomte, I am! Ha!
Crikey, this inn's a bit flipping dear, en't it? I heard these snow hotels cost a bundle, but seriously, this is daylight robbery, mun! And it's nighttime!
Tidy! Lovely and warm, this little number is! And just my size as well! Where the heck d'you reckon they got a size XXXS from? There's clever of them!
This little fur-lined onesie pushes my cuteness levels through the roof, mun! Go on, pick us up and give us a cwtch! You know you want to!
Tidy! Now we can get out of town the back way and all!
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?

Perdida's the place, and Khulan's the face!<NL>Let's go a-looking, shall we?
That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now 'til the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea to, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!

What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-Crikey!<NL>It's a bit nippy round by here, en't it?
S-S-S-S-Soup... A nice warm b-b-b-bowl of s-s-s-soup... Poured all over my h-h-h-head. That'd warm me up!
Blimey, look at them big lights in the sky, mun!<NL>I haven't been in a production this classy since I did that panto down in Ding Dong Dell!
Reckon we could convince one of these big snowman people to work for us as a familiar? Nah, mun. Wouldn't fit in the cage, en't it...
Makes me feel all warm and safe looking at them tomte people, it does. I just want one to pick me up and give me a big old cwtch. Ahh...
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
Fancy a race, Ollie-boy?<NL>I'm faster than I look, en't it!
What was it again...? I was sure I had something to tell you. Proper funny it was, too... Knickers!
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
Wahey!
Youer not asking me for help again, are you!?
Lay off for a bit, will you? Even us fairies need a bit of time to ouerselves now and again...
Ning to you! I am being Drippy, Lord High Lord of the Fairies! What d'you reckon? Not a bad impression, eh? Heh heh.

...!<NL>.........
Ah, it's you, Ollie! You must have a lot of time on your hands to climb all the way up here.
Well, we had a dragon to take us here. It must have been tough for you though, huh?
Hardly! One of the great things about being a ghost is that I can go pretty much anywhere.
Anyway, take a look at the words on this board here. They're written in funny letters, aren't they?
Those are from the Sagely Stone Age. This town is so remote that there are still traces of those times here.
Blimey! I can't make head nor tail of that wonky writing. I s'pose they do look a bit like Nazcaän, now that I think about it.
Maybe you're not as stupid as you look, pip-squeak. They're actually based on Nazcaän runes.
And speaking of Nazcaän, it's been a while since I gave you something to decipher.
If you look through the chapter called "Regions of the World" in your Wizard's Companion, you'll find bits of Nazcaän here and there.
There's <color:#1>a certain character that only appears in one location</color>. My question is: <color:#1>where</color> is it?
Don't worry, this one isn't as hard as it sounds. Well, not quite! Heh heh! When you work it out, let me know.
Have you worked it out yet, Ollie?<NL>Let me give you the question again.
There's <color:#1>a certain character that only appears in one location</color>. The question is: <color:#1>where</color> is it?
Remember, just because it's Nazcaän, it doesn't mean it's long. I'm not asking you to trawl through an ancient poem or anything. Or even a whole word...
You got it, Ollie! Each area marked on the maps corresponds to a number written in Nazcaän.
And the only character that appears once is the "6" next to "Jabal al-Dukhan."
Looks like you're really getting to know your way around the Wizard's Companion. I think that deserves a reward!
Gee! Thanks, Horace! I'm sure it'll come in real handy!
Oh, can I ask you something? Do you know anything about a little island that has a monument with Nazcaän writing on it?
Off in the sea to the west of the Fairyground, it is.<NL>D'you know the one we mean?
West of the Fairyground? Hmm... Oh, I think there was a big battle there during the Wizard Wars.
But I'm sure there used to be a much bigger island there. Where can this new one have sprung from?
Well, Mam always told us fairies she made all the islands round by there. Maybe she wasn't talking out of her hat after all...
Really? So the fairies' mum can do creation magic? Interesting...
Eh? You really reckon she wasn't fibbing? Ha! There's more to my old mam than meets the eye! ...Hold on a minute! How d'you know all this?
...Hm? How? I, um...<NL>That's a good question. I don't remember.
You sure do know an awful lot, Horace. I'll bet<NL>there isn't a single thing you don't know about<NL>the Wizard's Companion!
Just what's youer story, mun? How come you know all about the dim and distant past?
I told you, pip-squeak—I'm the Sage of Ages!
That's not a flipping answer!
But it's all I can remember! I'm Horace, the Sage of Ages... Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine...
You really can't remember?
I was certain that traveling the world would help bring back more of my memory... But now I'm not so sure...
Sometimes I feel like it's all coming back to me, but then it goes again, and I'm right back where I started...
Bah, who cares? What matters is that I can go wherever I like and see whatever I please. Why fret about a little thing like losing my memory?
I guess so...<NL>I mean, as long as you're sure you're happy...
...I'll be fine. And if I do remember something, you'll be the first to know. I'll be waiting back where we first met...
Bye for now!
I can go wherever I like and see whatever I please.<NL>Why fret about a little thing like losing my memory?
But if I do remember anything, you'll be the first to know. I'll be waiting for you in the place where we first met.
Why do you come to this sacred place? Be gone from here at once!
Look! Have you ever seen a sight more beautiful than the evening sun from this mountain of ours?
Gee! You're right! It sure is pretty, Ma'am.
Flipping heck! Get a load of that! You don't see a view like that every day!
Yes! Drink it in, for this beauty is all of ours to enjoy!
From this mountain, we see the sun sink into the sea each evening, and bid farewell to the day.
We watch each of the colors drain from the world, as the night sky dons its starry robes. Its beauty takes my breath away every time.
Wow... I bet that's really something. I sure would love to see it!
Oh, but you must! You must! Nowhere in this world has a sunset that can match that of Perdida. Of that, I am sure!
This lady's sure got a lot of <color:#1>confidence</color>.
Well, is it any blooming wonder? That's a backdrop and a half, mun! Makes me look all epic and windswept, en't it?
...
What are you giving me that look for!?<NL>If you've got something to say, spit it out, mun!
Um, pardon me, Ma'am. I was wondering if you could maybe help us out.
Well, I am not sure if I am able to. What is it you want from me?
Listening to you talk about the view, you sound real sure of what you think. I was wondering if you might share some of your confidence with us.
You wish to...borrow my confidence? Truly, you say strange things. But I see that you mean no harm.<NL>Please proceed.
Thank you, Ma'am! Okay, here goes...
Ai-ai-ai! My heart... It tingles!
Ah, look! The sun begins its descent.<NL>Please do not miss the beauty about to unfold.
Nowhere in this world has a sunset that can match that of Perdida. Of that, I am sure!
You sure do have a lot of <color:#1>confidence</color>, Ma'am!<NL>Say, would you maybe do us a favor?
Well, I am not sure if I am able to.<NL>What is it you want from me?
We were wondering if you'd mind sharing some of your confidence.
My confidence? Truly, you say strange things. But I can tell that you mean no harm. Please go ahead.
Have you ever seen a sight more beautiful than the evening sun from this mountain of ours?
¡Hola! I love to live in Perdida!<NL>It's like we are one big family!
You come from another land? This is our home.<NL>Perdida is small, but we have big hearts.
Hermana! I am so hungry!
I am sorry, hermanito! I will prepare dinner now.<NL>What do you want to eat?
Oh, thank you, hermana! Can you make stew again? Please, hermana!
Is he your little brother, Miss?<NL>You two seem to get along real well!
We get along very well, it is true, but he is not my<NL>real brother.
Really? Seeing you acting so kind, I was sure you must<NL>be family.
As you see, our town is very small.<NL>We are all like family here.
Everyone in this town cares for each other. We look after the young and the old as if they were our own family.
Gee... A town where everybody treats each other like family sure sounds nice.
Yes. We are truly blessed. I love my home with all<NL>my heart.
Wow... This girl sure has a whole lot of <color:#1>love</color>, huh,<NL>Mr. Drippy?
Um, excuse me, Miss. We were wondering if we could ask you for a favor.
A favor? Please, tell me more.
Well, um, we were wondering if you'd be kind enough to share some of the love in your heart.
Ha ha! Truly, people from far away are very different from us! Tell me. What must I do?
Just hold still for a second. It won't take long.
Is it over now? I am not sure what you did, but my heart feels light.
I will prepare dinner now, hermanito!
Everyone in this town cares for each other, you see.<NL>Ah, I love my home with all my heart.
A favor? Please. Tell me more.
Well, um, we were wondering if you'd be kind enough to share some of the <color:#1>love</color> in your heart.
Please wait, hermanito! I will prepare dinner now!
Tra la la laaa la-la! La la la laaa!<NL>Tell me, how do you like my song?
Tra la la laaa la-la! La la la laaa!
Gee! You sure do have a pretty voice!
Thank you! But it is not yet good enough.<NL>I need to practice more!
Wow, and you're real determined too, huh?<NL>Are you practicing for a concert or something?
Well, yes, in a way. When my singing gets better, I would love to sing for everyone.
Then I will travel to Al Mamoon and become the most famous singer in the whole world!
Jeepers! You sure do think big! But if you work real hard, I'm sure your dream will come true someday.
Look, Ollie-boy! Youer Locket's outshining my lantern! This girl's got <color:#1>ambition</color> to spare, and no mistake!
Um, listen... If you don't mind, we'd like to ask a favor.
A favor?<NL>Well, I will try to help...
Swell! Would you mind closing your eyes for just a couple of seconds?
Tee hee! This game is fun!<NL>Now, I will close my eyes!
Tee hee! What happened? My heart... It tickled a bit...
One day, I will travel to Al Mamoon and become the most famous singer in the whole world!
I must keep singing! I must make my dream come true!
You will see! When I am big, I will be the greatest llapaca herder in Perdida!
It is no good... I will never be a llapaca herder.
Gee, what's the matter? You sure do look sad<NL>about something.
I do not care anymore! Why should I spend my days chasing after stupid llapacas?
I could become the greatest llapaca herder in Perdida,<NL>but so what? It does not matter to anybody!
Well, gee... I think it does matter! I mean, you'd be doing an important job, and everybody would respect you.
Listen to him, sunshine! They're wise words, they are!<NL>I taught you well, Ollie-boy!
Being the best llapaca herder in Perdida would be swell, wouldn't it?
Hmmm... Maybe... I no longer know. I no longer spend my days dreaming about herding my llapacas through the fields at sunset...
Well, you know what this is a case of, don't you, Ollie-boy? Pooer lad's lost his <color:#1>ambition</color>, en't it. Brokenhearted, he is.
We can't just leave him like this!<NL>We have to help him get his ambition back!
Nice one, Ollie-boy! Let's see if there's a chunk of <color:#1>ambition</color> going begging somewhere round by here.
Hmm... I s'pose he'll live... But it's not much of a life if you don't have a dream, is it? Suit youerself, though...
I wanted to be the best llapaca herder in Perdida, but I no longer care...
I will never be the greatest llapaca herder in Perdida.<NL>But who cares? It was a stupid dream...
All set, Ollie-boy? Wave youer wand, cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color>,<NL>and send some <color:#1>ambition</color> ouer mate's way.
Ai-ai-ai! I feel very...different!<NL>What did I worry about? I forget...
...No matter! My precious llapacas must be led out to pasture! I have no time to waste!
Now there's one llapaca-loving lad!<NL>Looks like he's back to his old self!
He sure does!<NL>Hopefully now he'll make his dream come true.
He he! Thank you for listening to me.<NL>Talking with you really helped!
Please, take this!<NL>Thank you!
Llapacas are beautiful, are they not?<NL>Their hair is so long and silky!
Oh, it's you! Nice to see you again!
Listen, dear, don't you think it's time to go? We'll get no business done in an out-of-the-way place like this.
That doesn't sound like you, darling! We've always managed to make a decent living, no matter where<NL>we've gone.
It's nice to see you both again!<NL>...Is everything okay?
Ah, it's you! Well, the thing is, my darling wife has suddenly decided that we don't stand a chance of selling anything here.
I... I don't know. I just don't think I can carry on like this, going from one place to the next, only ever scraping by...
I mean, even if we did get our dream shop off the ground, how long would we last? A year? A month? What if the customers stopped coming?
You know, this looks a lot like...
You've got it, Ollie-boy! Her <color:#1>confidence</color> is in short supply!
So, are we going to do something about it, or what?
They've traveled so far, and worked so hard.<NL>We can't just let them throw it all away!
How many times have we helped this pair out now...? Anyway, you know the drill, Ollie-boy. She needs a <color:#1>confidence</color> boost, en't it.
But we've been through the flipping lot with this pair, mun! We can't give up on them now!
Ummm... Is something the matter?
I just don't think I can carry on like this, going from one place to the next, barely scraping a living... Sooner or later, the business will dry up, and then where will we be?
Looks like her <color:#1>confidence</color> is in short supply, Ollie-boy!
Even if we did get our dream shop off the ground, how long would we last? A year? A month? What if the customers stopped coming?
It's time to cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and treat the pooer girl to a much-needed <color:#1>confidence</color> boost!
...Oh! I feel all warm and tingly inside! All my worries seem to have just melted away!
Come on, my darling husband! We've got places to be and, most importantly, things to sell!
We'll be able to open our dream shop in no time!
Good luck with everything!
Ah, I almost forgot! Here's something for your trouble. Thank you for always being there for us.
Ah, it's good to see you again. This spot's nice and quiet, isn't it?
I'm afraid my dearest, darling wife is behaving a little strangely once again.
I'm begging you. Do what you can for my wife.<NL>She's not herself.
As long as we've got each other, there's nothing<NL>we can't do!
Ah... I cannot forget that dream...
Um, what's the matter?
It was yesterday. I had a strange dream.
What kind of dream was it?
It was...like no dream I have ever had. There was a girl who looked just like me. She had my face! But...she lived in another world.
In my dream, the girl was planting flowers I have never seen before. Beautiful flowers.
Gee. That does sound like a strange dream.
It was. And I felt something, too, though I do not know how. The girl and I, we were joined. It is hard to explain...
I reckon the girl she saw in her dream was from youer world, Ollie-boy.
They're soul mates, most likely.
What did you say? Does this boy really come from the same place as the girl in my dream—from another world!?
That's right. I come from another world, completely different from yours.
Is it true? It is incredible!
Can I ask you something, in case you ever meet that<NL>girl I saw?
Um, sure. I guess.
What I want is a flower. I would like very much to have one of the flowers that the girl in my dream grew.
If you meet her, please ask her for such a flower.
Thank you! The flowers I saw, they were pink—and in a pot! I have never seen flowers like them before.
Sounds to me like it's time to dust off a certain <color:#1>spell</color> and head back over to youer world, Ollie-boy!
I guess we'd better go find a girl who looks just like her.
Ah, I'm sorry I asked for too much. Never mind.
I cannot forget that dream...
In my dream, I saw a girl. She looked just like me. She even had my face! But she lived in another world. And there she planted the most beautiful flowers.
I would like very much to have one of the pink flowers that she grew.
Imagine it! Another world!<NL>It is so incredible!
Oh! It is so beautiful. This is just like the flower in<NL>my dream.
It's funny... I don't remember there being flowers like that in Motorville. I guess I never really looked...
There is something very calming about flowers, do you not think?
Thank you for bringing me the flower. Please accept this.
Thank you for bringing me the flower. I will look after it,<NL>I promise.
I love flowers. Just looking at them makes me very calm.
You cannot hold back the years, my friend, however hard you try. I have more aches and pains with each passing day. Many, many more!
Ai-ai-ai! My poor back, it aches!
Excuse me, Sir. Are you okay?
Ah, do not worry about me... It is just that I am old.
I have more aches and pains with each passing day.
Ai-ai-ai! It aches so! Would you be kind enough to help me, young man? You see, I cannot apply this—<NL>Hm? Oh...
Is something the matter, Sir?
It seems I have no more of the special compresses that I use to ease the pain.
And there's nothing else you can use?
I am afraid not. I bought a number of compresses from a peddler some time ago, but like youth, they did not last.
They were a special kind of <color:#1>cold compress</color>, handmade by a tomte who resides in Yule.
Whenever I placed one on my poor back, its icy embrace would swiftly soothe my pain.
Without one, I fear I will know no relief.
Can I ask a favor of you? Will you travel to Yule for me, and collect a <color:#1>cold compress</color> from the tomte there?
I am grateful to you. But remember that Yule is far from here. Take care. You must not endanger yourself on<NL>my account.
Thank you, Sir. I'm sure we'll be okay.<NL>You just wait here.
Oh. I am sorry to hear this. Now I have no choice but to await another peddler.
Ai-ai-ai! My poor back!
Young man, would you be so kind as to help me apply this— Hm? Oh...
It seems I have no more of the cold compresses that I use to ease the pain.
I favor a special kind made by a tomte who resides in Yule, you see.
Can I ask a favor of you? Will you travel to Yule for me, and collect a <color:#1>cold compress</color> from this tomte?
Please bring me a <color:#1>cold compress</color> from the tomte who resides in Yule. The pain... It is too much!
Ah, you have returned!<NL>Well, well! You truly traveled to Yule and back?
Without your help, I would have had to suffer until a peddler next arrived.
The tomte in Yule sends his regards, Sir.
Does he now? That is good to hear.
Ah, but I must not forget! I have a reward for you.<NL>Please take it.
I shall put the cold compress you brought me to good use, young one. You have made an old man happy.
Orgle! Borgle! Orgle!
Say, Mr. Drippy, what are these animals called?
That there is the noble llapaca, Ollie-boy! Majestic, en't it? Always had them in Perdida, they have.
It seems like he's trying to tell me something.
Youer not wrong. This hairy fellow's got something to say, and no mistake.
Time for a spot of <color:#1>magic</color>, I reckon.
Hello! I want you to do something for me!
I am simply starving. Can't you hear my tummy rumbling?
Might you have a tasty morsel for a hungry llapaca?
Ohh, so you want food, huh?<NL>Um... Sorry, Mr. Llapaca, but what do you eat?
My kind are fed hay, morning, noon, and night. But I have grown tired of its frankly one-dimensional taste and uninviting texture.
Is the merest hint of luxury too much to ask?<NL>A little gourmet treat, perhaps?
A gourmet treat, huh?
Precisely! Would it be so wrong for a humble llapaca to sample the delights of a juicy <color:#1>babana</color> from Al Mamoon?
How the heck he heard about babanas we'll never flipping know...
Ahem! There was a merchant who once came here. Amongst his wares were fresh babanas.
Ever since I first set eyes upon them, they have captivated me. I simply must try one! Might you be willing to provide me with one?
Bring me a babana, and I am sure I can find something similarly desirable to offer you in exchange.
Okay, sure. Just wait there.
Thank you! My tummy is rumbling with anticipation!
What's a llapaca doing demanding fancy food like that? It'll only make him sick! Stick to hay, that's what I say!
Bah! That's easy for you to say! Perhaps you would like to try a menu consisting solely of hay? Not hay three ways, with a delicate hay soufflé to finish, mind you—plain hay!
I am terribly hungry. Can't you hear my tummy rumbling?
I beg you. Please bring me a <color:#1>babana</color>!
I simply can't wait to try a <color:#1>babana</color>.<NL>Could you hurry up, please?
I simply can't wait to try a <color:#1>glowshrimp</color>.<NL>Could you hurry up, please?
I simply can't wait to try a <color:#1>black truffle</color>.<NL>Could you hurry up, please?
I simply can't wait to try a <color:#1>snow radish</color>.<NL>Could you hurry up, please?
Gosh! It's a babana! I'm going to enjoy this...
Om-nom-nom-nom!<NL>This is—nom—delicious!
It's so sweet, and soft, and fruity!<NL>Ah, it makes a change from hay, I can tell you!
Look at him gobble it down!<NL>In babana heaven, he is!
Ha, yeah, he sure does seem to be enjoying it!
...nom-nom! (gulp) Ah, that was delicious! But having experienced such a gastronomic marvel, it is clear to me just what I've been missing. I MUST taste further delights!
Still hungry, is it? Greedy great hairy lump!
Let me see, what do I want to eat for my next course...<NL>I know! A <color:#1>glowshrimp</color>!
Hold on, fur face! How did a llapaca in the middle of the flipping mountains come to hear of a rare and exotic type of seafood, then, eh?
The merchants who come to Perdida often speak of strange and wonderful foods. They don't think I can understand, but I am listening!
This hairy blighter's got an answer for everything!
Well, I guess we could bring you a <color:#1>glowshrimp</color>...
Excellent! I shall wait here for said exquisite morsel!
I say! It's a glowshrimp! How delightful!<NL>I can't wait to taste it...
Om-nom-nom-nom-nom!<NL>This—om—is—nom—exquisite!
I've never tasted anything quite like this...
It's tender and succulent, and leaves a delightful tang on the tongue.
So THIS is why people make such a fuss about seafood!
Listen to the way this hairball is carrying on!<NL>He's quite the culinary connoisseur, en't he?
He sure seems to know a lot about food.
...nom-nom! (gulp) That was a real treat!<NL>Now, on to the next course!
The next course!? This en't some fancy flipping restaurant, you cheeky so-and-so!
Um... Are you sure eating all this unusual food won't give you a stomach ache?
I thank you for your concern, but I shall be fine.
Now, on to the next course! I would like to sample a <color:#1>black truffle</color> from Hamelin.
You what!? D'you know how much those flipping<NL>things cost?
Cost? Hmph! I find the subject distasteful. Flavor is all that matters to me. But if you think money is more important than a hungry llapaca's humble dream...
Well, I guess we can bring you a <color:#1>black truffle</color>...
Ahh, that smell! Musk...nuts...dung... It must be a black truffle! Oh, I am going to enjoy this, I assure you!
Om-nom...mmm...nom-nom-nom!<NL>This is extra—nom—ordinary!
Ah... (gulp)
Flipping heck! I never thought I'd live to see a llapaca gorging himself on a black truffle!
There can be no mistake—the black truffle is indeed the king of foods!
It is richly fragrant, and boasts a flavor of incomparable depth. A taste for the true connoisseur.
Jeepers! He sure does know his food—and some real fancy words, too!
...But the texture was nothing special. That being the case, the next delicacy I should like to try is the legendarily crunchy <color:#1>snow radish</color> of Yule!
Bah... Got the bit between his teeth now, hasn't he?<NL>How long's the greedy furbag going to keep eating?
Uh, he still seems pretty hungry.
I can't wait for the next course!<NL>My tummy's rumbling in anticipation.
Oh! You brought me a snow radish!<NL>Then without further ado, I'm going to tuck in.
Ooom-nom-nom! Mmm...
Ah, that crispy, crunchy texture is just so moreish!<NL>And snow radishes are good for you, too!
Its delightful iciness sends a tingle down the spine.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Ah, I do declare that I have eaten enough!<NL>My belly is fit to burst!
Thank you for indulging my whims and taking this humble llapaca on a whirlwind culinary tour of the world.
Before you delivered those delicate morsels, I had tasted only hay...and a shoe, out of curiosity. Rest assured, I shan't forget the flavors you have so kindly introduced me to!
Now, I promised that I would reward you, and so I shall. Here you go...
Oh, and there's more! I have a fine formula for you to use in your alchemical experiments.
Use it to make something tasty...and feel free to drop by and share it with me anytime.
He's got some blinking cheek! Does he think of nothing but his stomach, or what?
Thank you so much! And remember, if you ever have any tasty morsels you wish to share, you will find me here...eating hay.
You received a new alchemy formula!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
Oh, it's you. It seems our paths have crossed once again. Of course, I predicted you would be here before long.
Gee! It's Derwin!
Oh, it's you again. How come youer always waiting for us, wherever we go?
Because I want you to assist me with my critically important research, of course.
So I guess that means you want us to find some more creatures for you, huh?
I applaud your perspicacity! Now, will you assist science and cooperate with me?
Science thanks you.
(sigh) What kind of creatures is he going to send us running off after this time, then?
Lately, I have been conducting highly stimulating research into the process of metamorphosis. But there are some creatures whose advanced forms I have yet to observe.
There are three specimens I would very much like you to bring me.
The first specimen of interest is a <color:#1>wispula</color>, the metamorphic successor of a ghostly creature known to haunt the Tombstone Trail.
I would also like to see at first hand a <color:#1>flash fry</color>—a species produced through the metamorphosis of a creature notable for carrying a pair of red-hot stones.
Finally, I wish to examine a curiously musical creature known as a...erm...<color:#1>trumpy</color>... (mumble) I am sure you know the species in question! And no, I shall not repeat myself.
Gee, this doesn't sound like it's going to be easy.
Little is known about these creatures, even amongst the familiarological fraternity. As such—you're on your own.
Still, with a combination of dedication and animal cunning, it is statistically likely that you will find them. Eventually.
Oh, and it goes without saying that it will not suffice simply to stash these specimens in a Familiar Retreat.
No, you must bring all three of these creatures<NL>to me together.
Clearly you believe the advancement of human knowledge is less important than...whatever it is you do.<NL>I think you'll find that you are wrong.
Little is known about the aforementioned creatures, so I am more than usually eager to see them in the flesh.
Oh, and it goes without saying that it will not suffice to simply stash these specimens in a Familiar Retreat.
Yes, these are correct.
It would seem that you have successfully brought me the specimens I requested.
Moreover, you did so in marginally less time than predicted, based on my estimation of the subjects' rarity and your intelligence. Clearly, another factor is at work...
But I shall look into that later. For now, I must immerse myself in my studies. That will be all.
Gee, Derwin sure does love science, huh?
Yeah, a bit too flipping much, if you ask me.<NL>Lad needs to find himself a girlfriend...
Oh, you are scarcely aware of the scale of the contribution you have made to my research.
I stand on the brink of a truly momentous discovery. Soon, the deepest mysteries of creaturekind will be revealed to me, and science shall be the beneficiary.
Well, I hope science is more grateful than you are!
...What was that? No matter. In return for your continued assistance, I shall reward you. Here.
I think you'll find I requested three specimens, while you have only collected two. I still require a <color:#1>wispula</color>.
As I clearly stated, the <color:#1>wispula</color> is the metamorphic successor of a ghostly creature known to haunt the Tombstone Trail.
I think you'll find I requested three specimens, while you have only collected two. I still require a <color:#1>flash fry</color>.
As I clearly stated, the <color:#1>flash fry</color> is a species produced through the metamorphosis of a creature notable for carrying a pair of red-hot stones.
I think you'll find I requested three specimens, while you have only collected two. I still require a...um... Ahem! I still require a <color:#1>trumpy</color>... (mumble)
As I clearly stated, the...um...specimen in question is a curiously musical creature... Surely that is more than enough information.
I think you'll find the <color:#1>wispula</color> and <color:#1>flash fry</color> are conspicuous by their absence.
The <color:#1>flash fry</color>, meanwhile, is a species produced through the metamorphosis of a creature notable for carrying a pair of red-hot stones.
Don't come back until you've found them!
I think you'll find the <color:#1>wispula</color> and, um, <color:#1>trumpy</color>... (mumble) ...are conspicuous by their absence.
While the <color:#1>trumpy</color>...um, creature—as we familiarologists call it for short—is a curiously musical beast...
I think you'll find the <color:#1>flash fry</color> and, um, <color:#1>trumpy</color>... (mumble) ...are conspicuous by their absence.
You will be interested to hear that my groundbreaking research is going from strength to strength. It is only natural that you take pride in having assisted me.
My colleagues in the familiarological fraternity said nothing of Perdida's literally breathtaking altitude. I feel somewhat light-headed.
But I will endure it for the sake of science!<NL>Wherever my studies lead, I will follow!
Looks like we've patched up the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
We'd best let him know, en't it?
Looks like we've patched up all the rifts<NL>that Conductor character was on about, eh?
That'll be the end of it then, I s'pose.<NL>We'd best let him know, en't it?
Our mountain town is far from other people, but still we can live well here.
We pass knowledge and alchemy formulae from generation to generation.
You know about alchemy, huh?
Of course! Since we were children, we have watched all Anciana does.
So she taught you, huh? Say, would you mind sharing some of your formulae with us?
I would not mind at all! Have fun trying them out!
Gee! Thanks!
You received some new alchemy formulae!<NL>Go to the cauldron to try them out!
I have never taught these formulae to anyone before! I hope they will be useful for you.
Ah, Oliver! We meet again!
I highly recommend that you continue along this path. Something rather interesting may well await you.
What's that? The fog has cleared over the Miasma Marshes, you say?
Can that really be true, I wonder? Well, there's only one way to find out...
Welcome to one of the Cat's Cradle chain of purremium inns! We purride ourselves on our purracticality and purricing!
Your custom is always apurreciated!<NL>Have a nice nap!
We don't get an awful lot of visitors up here in Purrdida.
Ever since Queen Khulan brought her blessings to this place, a guard has stopped anyone entering the town. It's all a little purrculiar.
Look, Ollie-boy! Youer Wizard's Companion's filling up! That'll be the memories of the folk who've stayed here, I reckon!
Eh!? That page en't even about this town!<NL>Where the heck is that, when it's at home?
I trust you had another purrfect night's sleep at the Cat's Cradle? Travel safely now!
And remember...<NL>Your next nap need never be far away!
Welcome to Swift Solutions, where those in need come to watch their worries fly away!
People with more troubles than they can swallow will place notices on the <color:#1>Errand Board</color> over there. Check it regularly to see if you can help out.
Oh, hello. How can I help you today?
I'll be seeing you soon!
¿Qué? You found Perdida all by yourself? Well, you are welcome.
We do not have much here, but what we have is yours to enjoy.
In a place like this, there is not much to do. I wish that something very exciting would happen...
Look at the water! It is so clear! Can it come from the Miasma Marshes, really? I do not know.
This town is so small. In Perdida, we are all like one big family.
¡Hola! It is strange to see strangers here!<NL>Why do you come?
I am busy now! I am making a secret base! When I finish, come and play with me!
Look! Look! A grasshopper!<NL>Wait for me!
I love this place. The sunset, it is so beautiful from up here.
Beyond lie the Miasma Marshes. Once you enter, it is not easy to leave.
But you do not need to speak! I can tell from your eyes...
You must go there, I think?<NL>Well, take care. I beg you.
¡Hola! It is another fine day in Perdida!<NL>As long as I have my health, I am happy.
All I want is a quiet life. Danger? Adventure? Excitement? No, they are not for me...
In Perdida, it is as if time itself has stopped.
Here, life is lived at our own pace.
We have no worries. We have no fears.<NL>We merely wish to live in peace.
When are we going to start looking for this Kublai bloke's hideout, hm?
Itching to get over to Kublai's hideout, I am!
We'd best go and see this dragon, eh?<NL>Tengri, was it?
You know the right spell to talk to Tengri already, mun! Come on, now! To Kublai's hideout!
We'd better let Kublai know what's up with Tengri, eh, mun?
Let's hurry up and find that dragon's soul mate, shall we?
Motorville, mun! And make it snappy!
I reckon we should go and have a word with that dog in front of Leila's shop, mun.
Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface? He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!
We need to find them three stones, mun!
Where to start, eh, Ollie-boy?
They've started doing that Solosseum Series down at the Temple of Trials now, apparently...
Two more stones to go, mun!
Where to next, Ollie-boy?
Ahh, I love flying round on Tengri, I do!<NL>Beats walking any day!
Not long now, and Mornstar will be back with a flipping vengeance!
Crikey! Only one stone left to get!
Let's find that last stone shall we, mun?
Let's go and give Marcassin a grilling, shall we?
Hightail it to Hamelin! Hasty, like!
What do you reckon's going on with that soldier from Xanadu over in front of the palace in Hamelin, eh?
Time to take a trip on old Tengri, I reckon!
What's this blessing thing everyone's on about? D'you reckon they'll do it to me? I'm pretty blessed already, actually. Best save it for those who need it...
I don't like the sound of this ceremony, Ollie-boy. Set my lamp a-tingling, it has...
Looks nice and peaceful this place, en't it? Almost too peaceful...
What's the Great Sage Khulan doing all the way out by here? Something funny's going on...
Shall we go and see what this ceremony's all about, Ollie-boy?
Have you spoken to that soldier from Xanadu, Ollie-boy? You should, mun. Interesting bunch, the Xanaduvians.
How many bits of heart are we going to get off old Pirateface? He's a bottomless pit of emotion, that one!
Ahh, there's manly! Nothing like a bit of obsessive, unrequited love to tug at the old heartstrings!
Looks like youer cue to play cupid, Ollie-boy!
Khulan said to go and see her when we're ready, en't it? I'm ready, Ollie-boy. Are you?
So Kublai's some big shot in the Xanaduvian army, is it? And those sky pirates are his soldiers? Crikey, you really can't judge a book by its cover, can you?
Let's go and get this Mornstar ceremony underway shall we, Ollie-boy? It's time to make the wand the way it was once more!
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Ollie-boy, what are you up to!?
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...
Where's that Pea to, eh?
We've got to save the three kingdoms, en't it?<NL>We need to find those black crystal things, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell and Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Hamelin left to save now, mun!
There's just Al Mamoon left to save now, mun!
There's just Ding Dong Dell left to save now, mun!
Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
I never knew there was a little village all the way up by here, mun! There's remote!
Ahh, that sunset... Brings a tear to my eye, it does... Eh? Nothing, mun! I was just, um, rehearsing some lines, en't it?
Must cost a fortune to cart supplies all the way up here, eh? S'pose that's why the shop here's so flipping dear!
What is this place anyway, mun? I can't work out if it's a villagey temple or a templey village. Confusing the heck out of me, it is...
That building up the top there looks like a face, mun. Proper weird, it is...
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.
Even heroes need to take a break every once in a while, mun. Don't overdo it, will you?
You sure youer familiars en't getting peckish, Ollie-boy? Best have a check, en't it?
Is there something stuck to my face?<NL>Besides the flipping lantern I mean,<NL>you cheeky so-and-so!
You know, when all this is over, I'm going to miss—erm... Misbehave, mun! Go crazy, I will. Fairy rarebit for breakfast, babana flans all day long...
What's up? Sorry, mun—if it's a pep talk youer after, I'm a bit short of wise words at the moment. Got a few unwise ones if you fancy them...
Never fear, Drippy's here!<NL>Whether he likes it or not...
Any tasks you've not cleared up yet, Ollie-boy? Well worth doing, they are, if you can spare the time.

.........!<NL>...!
Oliver! It's you! Thank goodness you're here!
What's wrong, Horace?
I stowed away aboard a ship in Castaway Cove, but when I woke up, I was here!
I never knew there was a whole forest full of these little loonies! When did this happen?
Why, you cheeky little beggar! The Fairyground here has been the center of fairy culture for centuries!
Only centuries? Well, it wouldn't have been here when I was on my travels, then...
Eh? What are you on about?
Nothing. Anyway, it may not be where I expected to see you next, but let's give you your next puzzle anyway,<NL>shall we?
You're getting to be a pretty good wizard these days, Oliver. That means you must have a genie at your command.
A genie? You mean Al-Khemi?<NL>Sure I do!
Good, then this will be nice and easy for you. You've seen the formulae gathered by wizards over the years in the Wizard's Companion, haven’t you?
I often used to whip myself up a nice burger when I was on my travels...
You did? Burgers are my favorite, too!
Then you'll know just what <color:#1>that certain special something no burger can do without</color> is, won't you?
Do you know what I'm talking about?<NL>It's the one ingredient all burgers need.<NL>Let me know when you've worked it out.
This question is about alchemy—one of the pillars<NL>of wizardry.
There's <color:#1>a certain fresh ingredient that no burger can do without</color>. Can you tell me what it is?
You like burgers, don't you?<NL>Then this should be easy-peasy!
That's right! The one ingredient no burger can do without is a nice portion of crispy lettuce!
Burgers, eh? We used to have a burger place by here, you know. McDafydd's, it was called... I used to love popping down there for a nice, juicy McRarebit...
Wow, that does sound good!<NL>I'd love to try one!
Me too!
...Wait! I've just remembered something!
What is it, mun?
There was another page from the Wizard's Companion I meant to give you, but I lost it somewhere...
It was for a funny little spell called <color:#8>Levitate</color>. Maybe one of these fairies found it... Anyway, if you come across it,<NL>it's yours.
Uh, thanks.
But that means I need to think of something else to give you for answering my question...
Oh, I know! It was a question about alchemy, after all... Here you go!
It's the recipe for the Sage of Ages' super-special mega medicine! You should give it a try—it can cure anything!
Right—I can't stay on this island full of loonies any longer! I'm off to the next town!
Maybe I'll hop on the back of one of those big sea beasts and ride over to the nearest continent...
See you soon!
If I can hop aboard one of those big sea creatures, I can get out of this lunatic asylum and over to the nearest continent...
Eat ouer food. It's all tasty and that.
............
Uh, did I do something wrong, Sir?
I, uh... I'm real sorry if I offended you...
Shut up, mun! What are you apologizing for?
It's not youer fault old Zip Lip here's refusing to open his trap, is it? Oi! You! What's youer problem?
...........Nothing personal, like. I just don't see the point in all that "How do? Nice weather we're having..." rubbish<NL>is all...
Y-You don't see the point in paying youer customers the most rudimentary of courtesies!? Flip, mun! What kind of flipping shopkeeper are you!?
Calm down, Mr. Drippy!
I will not flipping calm down! Youer a disgrace to the fairy race, mun! I've never seen such a disgusting display in all my long years!
...Oh. Hang about. He's probably heartbroken, en't it.<NL>Lost his <color:#1>kindness</color> or something...
You're right. He probably has, huh.<NL>Shall we help him get it back?
Too flipping right we shall! Me, leave one of my fairy comrades in need? Never! One super-size portion of <color:#1>kindness</color> coming up!
Oi! This is the bit where youer s'posed to say, "Sure thing, Mr. Drippy! Let's go help him, Mr. Drippy!" Honestly!
He sure doesn't look too happy...
Oi! Say something, will you? Youer scaring youer pooer customers, mun!
...Haaang on a sec! Youer flipping heartbroken, en't you! Had youer <color:#1>kindness</color> stolen, en't it!
I guess I'd better cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand over some <color:#1>kindness</color>, huh?
Huh!?
What the—!?<NL>Was he not brokenhearted or something?
............How do?
Oh...
............Sorry about before, en't it?
............Have a nice day and that.
For flip's sake, mun!<NL>He's hardly changed at all!
Well, he, uh...seems a little...happier, don't you think...?
Honestly, mun... You go away for five minutes and the whole fairy race goes to pot!
............Come again, en't it.<NL>Here's a present, like.
Tidy! I'm going to make this lot laugh so hard they'll wet their flipping selves!
Knickers, mun...<NL>Why can't I stop myself...?
Is something the matter?<NL>You seem kinda upset...
Too right I flipping well am.<NL>I love making people laugh, see...
And I've been all over doing comedy and that. Raised smiles from here to the Winter Isles, I have...
And what exactly is so tragic about that?
I'm just getting to that, en't I? The thing is is...recently, see, I just can't help coming out with jokes in completely the wrong situations...
The other day, I tried doing a funny when I went to visit my butty who's laid up sick in bed, and before that, it was at this proper important meeting...
Hmm. Yeah, that doesn't sound too good...
I can't help myself. I just comes out with whatever comes into my head.
I'm there going, "Not now, not now, not now," but before I knows it, it just...happens...
I think I see the problem. Heartbroken, you are.<NL>You've had youer <color:#1>restraint</color> stolen, en't it?
Have I now? That makes sense, I s'pose...
But don't worry, I reckon we can help you out.<NL>What do you say, Ollie-boy?
Tidy! Don't forget now—it's <color:#1>restraint</color> we need, and plenty of it!
Well, I don't s'pose it's that urgent. I feel a bit sorry for the pooer lad, like, but it can't be helped, eh...
Recently, I just can't help coming out with jokes in completely the wrong situations.
That's no good, is it? I think I see the problem, though. Heartbroken, you are. You've had youer <color:#1>restraint</color> stolen, en't it?
He has, huh? So that's why he can't help telling jokes at the wrong time.
Knickers, mun...<NL>I just can't flipping help myself...
You got some <color:#1>restraint</color> there, en't it, Ollie-boy?<NL>Go on, cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and hand it over.
Ooh-err, that's a proper funny feeling, that is.<NL>But nice, mind you...
So, do you feel any different?
...Do you know what, I...I reckon I do! I don't feel like blurting out jokes willy-nilly anymore!
Ta, mun! You've proper sorted me out!<NL>Here—to say thanks, like!
Just you wait! We're going to be the biggest thing in this town since Mam's food bill!
It's no good, mun. I en't ever going to be any good at the old comedy game. Reckon the best thing is if I just give it all up...
Eh? What's up with you all of a sudden, mun?<NL>Keen as mustard you were until five minutes ago!
Is something the matter?<NL>You look kinda worried...
Too right I am! We're a comedy duo, see?
But suddenly my partner in crime here is talking about giving it all up! I ask you!
There's drastic.<NL>Why the sudden change of heart, you?
I dunno. I just... I en't cut out for the stage, am I?<NL>I'm just not funny enough.
Says who? Funny as anything, you are!<NL>Especially with me feeding you the set ups!
Sorry, mun... I can't. I just en't got the confidence for it<NL>no more...
<color:#1>Confidence</color>! Of course! He's had every last bit of it drained out of him, the pooer brokenhearted boyo!
If he doesn't get a boost soon, these two's career is over...
We can't just leave them like this Mr. Drippy?<NL>Let's help them!
That's the spirit, Ollie-boy! We'd best come up with some <color:#1>confidence</color> then, en't it?
I hate to have to leave them like this, but we're already<NL>so busy...
There's tragic! This pooer brokenhearted boyo's had every ounce of <color:#1>confidence</color> drained out of him!
I just... I en't cut out for the stage, am I? I'm just not funny enough.
Here, Ollie-boy, cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and get the old <color:#1>confidence</color> a-flowing, will you?
...Eh? There's funny. I feel all...calm, and...confident! Yeah! Itching to do a bit of a routine, I am! Point me at the stage and watch me go!
Really? Got youer confidence back, have you?<NL>Honest, like? This en't a rubbish joke or nothing?
Nah, mun! Proper fearless, I am! I reckon I could do a gig in front of Shadar himself and not bat an eyelid!
You lot are flipping lifesavers! Ta, mun, seriously.<NL>Here, it en't much, but it'll have to do.
Ahhh! There's nothing like a nice cold drink after a hard day's work, eh? There's rewarding!
What the flip are you on about, mun!? Give up comedy? If that's youer idea of a joke, maybe you should give up—cos it's not flipping funny!
Come on, mun! Think it over! Youer proper funny!<NL>Why would you give it all up?
That's the spirit!<NL>Let's get out there and split some sides!
What's going on in this forest?<NL>It's absolutely riddled with fairies!
N-Not that that bothers me, of course.<NL>Right, let's get selling. Roll up, roll up!
I, I can't take it!<NL>This forest is... It's just too much!
Darling, pull yourself together, please!<NL>What are you so frightened of all of a sudden?
Hi there. Is something wrong?
Oh, it's you! You have to help!<NL>My husband's having yet another funny turn!
I don't know what it is, but I'm petrified of traveling all of a sudden. I don't think I can carry on being a peddler if I stay like this...
He seems...
Yep. Heartbroken. And this time, it's <color:#1>courage</color> he's lacking.
Well, there's nothing for it, I s'pose, them being old friends of ouers and all. We'd best help out, eh?
<color:#1>Courage</color>, Ollie-boy—that's what we need!<NL>Let's get to it!
Really? There's harsh, you are! Look at him, pooer dab! He's shivering with fright!
It's no good. I'm too frightened. I can't go on peddling like this!
I'm afraid I need your help again.<NL>My husband's had another funny turn.
It seems like he's lost all his <color:#1>courage</color>, huh?
Well, there's nothing for it, I s'pose, them being old friends and all. We'd better help out, eh?
We sure had! Let's cast <color:#8>Give Heart</color> and give him his <color:#1>courage</color> back!
...Hm? Goodness! I feel...brave!
Whatever was I so scared of? The only thing to fear is a poor day's sales! Roll up, roll up!
Thank goodness. Now we can finally get back to peddling our wares.
Please don't talk about giving up peddling again!
I won't! And thanks yet again.
Oh, here. This is to say thank you.<NL>Please, it's the least we can do.
I-It's no use...<NL>I'm too scared...
All right, let's sell, sell, sell!<NL>Roll up, roll up!
I knew there were all kinds of strange places in the world, but I never imagined anything like this...
Darling, are you all right?<NL>Can you sell in that state?
He's forever getting like this out of nowhere...
Thank you once again!<NL>I don't know what we'd do without you!
Crikey, I'm starving!<NL>Reckon I might get a bite to eat...
Let's see now, what's on the specials board today...?
Flip!
What's wrong?
Eurgh! Wh-What the heck is that smell, mun?
That'll be the special, I reckon.<NL>Sausage and custard omelet...
Gee, that sounds...interesting...
You could say that, yeah.<NL>This one's going to be a toughie...
Gah, listen to me! That's not my style!<NL>Bring it on, mun! That's what I meant to say!
Huh? You're going to try it?
'Course I am! There en't a special I haven't tried yet!<NL>And there've been some proper weird ones, and all...
Now that's what I call brave! He's got <color:#1>courage</color> coming out of his eyeballs!
He sure does! Say, Mr. Fairy...would you mind sharing some of your courage with us?
My courage, you say? ...'Course not, mun.<NL>Go for youer life.
You'd have to borrow a few bucketfuls before I noticed the difference!
Really? Gee, thanks!
Hee hee! Stop it, mun! It tickles!<NL>In a nice way, though...
Sausage and custard omelet, is it?<NL>I'd best give it a try then, eh?
Crikey, there's brave! This one's got <color:#1>courage</color> coming out of his eyeballs!
Say, Mr. Fairy...would you mind sharing some of your courage with us?
'Course not, mun. Go for youer life. You'd have to borrow a fair few bucketfuls before I noticed the difference!
Righto, let's see what's on the specials board today,<NL>shall we?
Flip, mun...that looks proper...nnngh...tasty...<NL>What I wouldn't do for...a lovely lard...nnngh...pie...
I en't going to let my...appetite get the better of me...<NL>I can resist it... Just...got to...be...strong...
What's wrong? You seem kinda...tense.
S'all right, mun... Just having a little...bet with my...butty by...nnngh...here...
Gee, what kind of bet?
Eh...? Oh, we're seeing...how long I can...go without eating one of my beloved...nnngh...lard pies...
A little test of the old willpower, is it? Nice!<NL>How long you been at it for?
Oh, um...only...five years...two hundred and twenty-seven days...two hours...four minutes...and sixteen seconds...
Jeepers creepers!<NL>You've really been doing it that long?
That is some serious flipping <color:#1>restraint</color>...
Here, you've got a genuine talent there, mun.<NL>Fancy sharing a bit of it with those who need it?
Sharing...it...? Go on...then...<NL>What do I have to...nnngh...do...?
Oh, you don't have to do anything.<NL>Just hold still for one second...
Is that...it...? Well, I won't...lie... Sounds proper weird, but...<NL>Go on...nnngh...then...
Thank you very much, Mister Fairy, Sir!
...Hang about! Suddenly resisting the pull of the pies<NL>feels one heck of a lot easier! Tidy! Is this youer doing?<NL>Ta, mun!
Flip, mun...them lard pies look proper...tasty... But I en't...giving in... I been...nnngh...resisting them for...nearly six...years now...
That is some serious flipping <color:#1>restraint</color>...<NL>Here, you—fancy helping us out a bit?
Yeah, mun... No...nnngh...worries...<NL>What do you...need...?
We just need you to hold still for one second!
Hold still...eh...?<NL>Doesn't feel much like...nnngh...helping...
Bring it flipping on!<NL>I could resist them pies for another century, mun!
(sigh) Feels like there's less and less of us lot every year... Tragic, it is...
...What am I saying? They'll come back! If I don't believe that, who will, eh? I en't giving up just yet!
Boy, you sure do seem determined, Mr. Fairy.<NL>What is it that you won't give up on?
Eh? Who are you when youer at home?<NL>...Bah, don't s'pose it matters. Let me explain.
You've heard there's less fairies these days than there used to be, en't it?
Sure. I don't know the exact details, but I think I heard that they went to another world or something?
There's well-informed, you are! Not bad for a littlie.
It's cos it's harder to live by here in this world than it used to be. There's all creatures gone nuts, and bad vibes and that. Terrible, it is.
En't it, though. Tries the patience something rotten...
But I en't giving up on ouer world just yet! One day, peace will return, and the fairies will fill the forests and fields once more!
Hey, Mr. Drippy, that's some real strong <color:#1>belief</color>, huh?
Leave this one to me, Ollie-boy! Oi, you!<NL>Gis a lend of youer belief, will you?
A bit of my belief? Oh, the old <color:#8>Take Heart</color> trick, is it?
That's the one. Ollie-boy here might look like a littlie, but he's actually sort of a wizard.
"Sort of"?
Cor! I en't seen a wizard in donkey's years.<NL>Go on, then! Help youerself, lad!
Tidy! I hope my heart will go on to help many souls<NL>in need!
I en't giving up on ouer world just yet! One day, peace will return, and the fairies will fill the forests and fields once more!
My belief, you say? Oh, the old <color:#8>Take Heart</color> trick, is it? Been a while since I saw a bit of wizarding. Go on then, lad! Have at me!
One day soon, the world will be just as full of fairy folk as it was in the olden days, you mark my words!
Roll up, roll up!
Roll up, roll up!<NL>Oi, you! Sonny Jim!
Huh? "Sonny"...? Do you mean me?
'Course, mun! Who else would I mean?<NL>Stop and have a bite to eat, will you?
It does smell pretty flipping tasty...
It really does! Um, what is it?
"What is it?" he says! Are you telling me you've never come across the Fairyground's most famous food—<NL>fairy rarebit?
Uh, no...I haven't...
Knickers! I knew I should've carried out my plan sooner!
What plan's that, mun?
I was going to open a fairy rarebit shop in every town and city in the world to spread the word of ouer wonderfood, wasn't I!
Flip, mun. That's a tidy little plan...<NL>Won't it be a bit hard, though?
'Course it will!
But if it's to teach the world about the fairies' finest foodstuff, it's worth it, en't it?
Well, if that doesn't show a tidy bit of <color:#1>ambition</color>,<NL>I don't know what does!
You're right, Mr. Drippy!<NL>Excuse me, Mr. Fairy, can I ask you something?
Eh? What is it?
We'd like to take a little of your ambition to help somebody who doesn't have enough of their own.<NL>Would that be okay?
'Course, mun!<NL>Go for youer life!
Ooh, there's nice! I feel flipping cracking!<NL>Like a new fairy, mun!
I'm going to spread the word of ouer finest delicacy all over the world! Everyone will have heard of fairy rarebit soon, you'll see!
Say, Mr. Fairy... We'd like to take a little of your ambition to help somebody who doesn't have enough of their own. Would that be okay?
Eh? 'Course you can, mun! I've no idea what youer on about, but go for youer life!
I en't giving up till the whole world knows the fabulous flavor of fairy rarebit!
Knickers! It's still no good! It needs to be at least four zillion times funnier! Arrrgh!
It's no good, mun! It's still nowhere near good enough! It needs more...more... It just needs more! Flip!
So then I says...NAH, MUN—I JUST SEEN THE OTHER FELLER COMING BACK WITH A BUNCH OF BABANAS!
Haa...haa....<NL>No good, mun... Needs more oomph, mun...
So then I says...NAH, MUN—I JUST SEEN THE OTHER FELLER COMING BACK WITH...A MASSIVE GREAT BIG BUNCH OF BABANAS!!!
...Uh, what are you doing, Mr. Fairy?
Eh? It's obvious, en't it?<NL>I'm practicing a punch line, en't I?
Huh? Oh, you mean the punch line to a joke?<NL>Gee, you sure are practicing, um...hard.
That's the only way to get it right though, en't it?<NL>True comedy doesn't come easy!
Never mind getting it right, mun!<NL>I want to nail it! Knock it out of the park, like!
How else am I going to become the greatest straight man the Fairyground ever saw?
Jeepers, that's some <color:#1>ambition</color>, huh, Mr. Drippy?
Youer not wrong, Ollie-boy.<NL>Oi, fancy lending us a hand, pal?
What...now?<NL>Can't you see I'm flipping busy?
Go on, you big idiot!<NL>It won't take a second.
All right, all right, if I have to.<NL>But only 'cause you asked so nicely...
Thank you very much!<NL>Hold still for just one second...
What the heck did you just do? I feel all...calm... Hmm... Maybe I am trying a bit too hard, eh?
I'm going to be the greatest straight man the Fairyground ever saw!
It takes some serious <color:#1>ambition</color> to have a goal like that.<NL>Oi, fancy lending us a hand, pal?
Hmm... Maybe there is such a thing as being too prepared...
I'd love to have a go at a bit of the old slapstick one day...
Knickers and flip!<NL>I'm going to have to skip town, mun...
Skip town? Are you in some kind of trouble?
Eh? What's it to you, bigears? We fairies don't take kindly to eavesdroppers, you know!
Oh, uh, sorry, Mr. Fairy, Sir.<NL>I'll forget I heard anything.
Nah, mun. Youer involved now.<NL>You'll have to help me.
Wh— But...I don't even know what you did... You aren't going to ask me to do something...bad, are you?
Don't be daft. All it is is...I've gone and got my butty's whole <color:#1>slapstick</color> collection stolen.
Stolen? Gee...<NL>How did that happen?
Well, I wanted to try my hand at a spot of the old slapstick humor, see...
So I, er...borrowed a few slapsticks from my butty, and went off into the woods for a bit of a practice, like.
Then these beasties jumped me, and next thing I know, there I am completely flipping slapstickless.
If my butty finds out, that's the end of ouer comedy duo. It's curtains for certain!
Gis a hand, mun, there's a pal! Get <color:#1>all three slapsticks</color> back for me, would you?
If you can get them back in time, he'll never know I nicked—er, borrowed them, en't it?
Ta, mun! Youer an absolute lifesaver!
So, do you remember what kind of creatures stole<NL>the slapsticks?
Yeah. <color:#1>Wishing whambats</color>, they were. Ran off looking proper pleased with themselves, the cheeky little blighters.
I guess they must really like slapsticks, huh?<NL>They might not give them up too easily.
Exactly! That's why you have to <color:#1>blind</color> them first! Then they won't be able to stop you taking the loot back off them once you beat them.
Blind them, beat them, and bring back <color:#1>all three slapsticks</color>. Piece of cake! Now get to it!
Why, you stingy little...!
Oi, hold up a mo!<NL>Can you spare some time for a fairy in need?
I've gone and got all my butty's <color:#1>slapsticks</color> pinched off me by flipping beasties, see.
And if I don't get them back, it's curtains for ouer comedy duo for certain! Reckon you can get them back for us?
<color:#1>Wishing whambats</color>, the creatures that stole them are called. And you'll have to <color:#1>blind</color> the blighters before you beat them.
Do that, and you'll be able to pluck <color:#1>all three slapsticks</color> from their thieving mitts no problemo! Get to it, then!
How do? Did you get them slapsticks back for me?
...What? Only one? That's no good! Hurry up and get <color:#1>the other two</color>, will you? I'm done for otherwise!
...Two so far, is it? Just the <color:#1>one</color> left to get, then!<NL>Don't give up now!
We got the slapsticks back for you, Mr. Fairy!
You did as well! You little beauty!<NL>Thank flip, mun!
You're welcome.<NL>Don't lose them again, will you?
...Heh. Yeah, mun, good old slapsticks... I flipping love these things! Gets you thinking about all them classic lines, en't it?
...Why, I oughta!
...You plonker, Rhodri!
...Take that, you big div! (whack) ...And that! (whack) ...And that! (whack) Grrrarrrgh!!!
Okay, youer starting to scare me now...
Ha ha! I'm sure you're going to make lots of people laugh! Good luck with your comedy career!
Here, I'd better give you a reward, en't it?<NL>My autograph should do it, right?
Uhh...no. Thank you.
Oh, greedy, is it? Want a little personal message thrown in as well, do you?
No, we're... We're fine.
.........<NL>...............
All right, all right! Don't give me that look!<NL>Here.
Slapsticks are well good, mun! I wish I was the one who got to do the whacking...
(sniff) I feel proper rotten, mun...<NL>I got the shivers and everything...
Are you okay?<NL>You look kinda sick.
You got this from jumping in the river when them littlies got born, en't it?
Bingo. Got carried away, didn't I?<NL>And now— Ah...ahhh...ahhh-CHOOO!!!
Did you take some medicine?
I en't got none, have I? And I can't go foraging for ingredients in my state...
Hey, you couldn't be a pal and get them for me, could you?
Ta, mun. I owe you one.
Don't be daft! We fairies have to stick together, en't it? What are these ingredients, then?
Let's see now...we'll need <color:#1>a bunch of booster shoots</color>, <color:#1>a bundle of slumbernot leaves</color>, and <color:#1>a bottle of springwater</color>.
Tidy.<NL>We'll be right back!
Yeah, he's only got himself to blame, I s'pose...
(sniff) I feel proper rotten, mun... I should never have gone and jumped in the river when them littlies got born...
Well, you've only got youerself to blame, mun.<NL>Looks like a proper nasty cold, too.
Sorry to keep you waiting!<NL>We brought the ingredients for your medicine!
Say ta!
Ta! Now I can finally get better!
And when I am, I'm not jumping in that river again, and that's a promise!
Well...I guess it was kind of a big moment.<NL>But maybe you shouldn't do it again.
There's no danger of that, mun, don't worry. Here, this should make up for the trouble of getting them ingredients.
We still need some <color:#1>slumbernot grass</color>. It's a bracing little eye-opener—just like me!
We still need some <color:#1>springwater</color>. Proper pure water that springs up over in the Summerlands, it is.
We still need some <color:#1>booster shoots</color>. They're the secret ingredient. Well good for colds, they are!
Don't forget, will you?<NL>Counting on you, I am!
We still need a bunch of <color:#1>booster shoots</color> and a bundle of <color:#1>slumbernot leaves</color>, en't it.
This springwater's not going to make me better on its own, is it? Hurry up, mun! I'm sick as a dog!
We still need some <color:#1>springwater</color> and a bundle of <color:#1>slumbernot leaves</color>, en't it.
I'm on my last legs here, mun...<NL>You've got to hurry...
We still need some <color:#1>springwater</color> and a bunch of <color:#1>booster shoots</color>, en't it.
Don't go copying me and jumping in the river, will you? It's a proper stupid idea...
We need <color:#1>a bunch of booster shoots</color>, <color:#1>a bundle of slumbernot leaves</color>, and <color:#1>a bottle of springwater</color> for this medicine.
My river-jumping days are over. Next time, I'll find a less stupid way of celebrating...
Oh, I say! How jolly lovely to see you again! Who'd have thought we'd end up meeting in a rummy old place like this, hm?
It's nice to see you too, Sir!<NL>How did you wind up here?
Well, I chartered myself a ship to old Autumnia, and spied this place from atop the crow's nest, as it were. Looked rather jolly, so I thought I'd take a look.
And lo and behold, I find myself in a town full of fairy folk! I really ought to jot down my first impressions, what! Let's see now...
...Oh. Oh, bother.
Youer kidding me, right?
I wish I were, old stick, but I rather seem to have mislaid my diary yet again. I really am a most insufferable blockhead.
You really flipping are—this is the third flipping time!
I rather fear it is, yes. Do you think you might be able to help a silly old sausage out this one last time?
Sure! Leave it to us!
Marvelous! Tally ho, what!
Teeheeti en't too big. One half-decent clue should put us on the right track...
Well now, let me see...I did happen across a little corker of what one might call a grotto or <color:#1>cave</color> on my wanderings.
Yes, took the weight off the old plates of meat with the aid of a <color:#1>fallen log</color>, and jotted down a few choice ponderings. Very pleasant...
A cave? I've never seen a cave round by here...<NL>Still, if you say so. Let's go and have ouerselves<NL>a goosey gander, shall we?
You won't? Bother... All my musings, gone forever...<NL>Such a tragedy...
It's good to see you again, Sir!<NL>How did you wind up here?
I, um...seem to have...misplaced the old diary yet again...
You couldn't be an absolute dear and track the rotten thing down, could you?
I'm almost certain I last saw it in a <color:#1>cave</color> I came across.
I took the weight off the old plates of meat with the aid of a <color:#1>fallen log</color>. I rather think it will be somewhere nearby.
Sorry we took so long!<NL>We found your diary!
You did?<NL>Oh, you absolute marvel, you!
It's kinda wet...<NL>Will it be okay?
Oh, what's a little damp between friends? Here—something for your trouble, old thing.
This really is rather a rummy old place...<NL>These fairy folk are the absolute limit...
......Eh?<NL>Oi, watch it, you! I'm a flipping fairy, en't I?
Cheeky so-and-so...
What the bally blue blazes is this place?<NL>Fairy folk everywhere...little blighters...
Looks like we've patched up the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
We'd best let him know, en't it?
Looks like we've patched up all the rifts that Conductor character was on about, eh?
That'll be the end of it then, I s'pose.<NL>We'd best let him know, en't it?
How do, boys?<NL>Long time no see, eh?
Drippy-boy! How do?<NL>Something up?
Well, I got something to ask you, as it goes.
Something to ask us? What is it, mun?<NL>We're not in trouble, are we?
Smiley 'n' Surly've really got a weapon shop, is it?<NL>I thought that was just part of their routine, like.
Nah, mun, it's all true. And they need stock, en't it.<NL>Can you think of any weapons that'll get the fairies<NL>flocking to their door?
What about youer old slapstick, Drippy-boy? There's not many more legendary weapons than that, is there?
My slapstick? Don't be daft! What would anyone want with that old bit of rubbish, mun?
Ahh, 'course... You've not been around lately, have you?
The youngsters these days reckon youer a proper legend, en't it. Youer known in fan circles as "Lord High Lord of the Laughs."
Lord High Lord of the Laughs, huh?<NL>That is one neat nickname!
En't it, though. Youer gags are the stuff of fairy legend, Drippy-boy. No one else's even come close!
Which is why the young 'uns have been going crackers for replicas of youer famous slapstick, en't it?
Really? Imagine that... Ahem! I mean, er—there's no accounting for taste, I s'pose. You got the details of this replica thingy to hand?
Ta, boys!<NL>This'll come in proper handy!
Glad to be of service, Drippy-boy!<NL>Give Smiley 'n' Surly ouer regards, eh?
You got the idea for the soppy slapstick!
Maaaaaaaaam!<NL>I'm hooome!
Is that you, Drippy-bach? Why don't you ever give me a bit of notice before you come home, eh? Leaving youer old mam in the dark, honestly...
I've not done my hair or my makeup or nothing! Look at the state of me! Goodness only knows what youer friends must think of me! The shame!
Shut up, will you? No one cares what you look like!<NL>Stop embarrassing me!
Anyway, there's more important things to talk about. Smiley 'n' Surly are in a proper pickle, and we need to bend youer ear about it.
Listen to him, cheeky little devil... And he was such a dear, sweet littlie. Whatever happened to the lad who loved his Mammy-Wammy-Woo, eh?
That's it, is it? Well, that's easy enough. I know just the thing you need. Came to me while you were yabbering on, it did.
Go on, then—tell us!
What you need is a weapon with a funny name to make youer customers smile, en't it? A lance should do it,<NL>I reckon.
Er...it should?
'Course it should! Trust youer old mam! Now...<NL>What about a nice healy one called an "ambu-lance"?
.........
No good? Tough crowd. Never mind...
You could give one away, I s'pose.<NL>Call it a "free-lance"...
Still not keen?
Crikey, you want the moon on a stick, you do! Of all my littlies, there en't a single one that ever gave me so much grief! The things I do for you!
The things you don't do, more like!
Don't you take that tone with me, young man! ...Fine! I'll give you my most secret secret—just don't blame me if you get embarrassed!
Oh, just shut up and tell us, will you?
It's the lance I used to rock you to sleep with before you were old enough to lip me so mercilessly. (sniff) My dear old lullaby lance...
Ohhh, don't go getting all dewy-eyed on me, love.<NL>You've got me started now... Welling up, I am...
...Shut up, mun!<NL>Ta for the idea. See you later...
You got the idea for the lullaby lance!
How do. A very...purrpendicular welcome to the most, er...purrspicuous inn in the whole Cat's Cradle chain!
I'm, um, purrfidiously sorry, but we en't open yet.
Youer custom is purroperly, um...purrvasive.<NL>Ta, I mean.
Youer custom is appurreciatedly, um...purrtinent.<NL>Ta, I mean.
Youer the first humans we've ever had stay by here! There's, um...purrfunctory!
Well, it'll make a change from the usual riffraff you have cluttering up the place.
...But riffraff or not, their memories still fill up the old Wizard's Companion, en't it? Tidy!
Morning. Did you have a purroper tidy night's sleep? Hope so! Travel safe now!
It's always, um...purroper tidy to see you.<NL>Ta-ra for now!
Welcome to Swift Solutions, where those in need come to watch their worries, umm...beak a hasty retreat.
People who are in a proper flap put notices on the <color:#1>Errand Board</color> over by there. Check it now and then to see feather or not you can help out, en't it.
Hm? Hoo's that, eh? Oh, hoo do!<NL>Hoo can I help hoo hooday?
Owl be hoogely hoobilant hoo see hoo again!
Caw! A flapping customer! I don't mean to beak crude, but every one of ouer items is a flapping cawker!
Ouer prices are flapping bonkers! I'm raven flapping mad, me!
Gaaaaaah! How did I ever end up in this nest of gnomes?
Oi! Who are you calling gnomes, you cheeky little flapper!
Gaaaaaah! You know how to give a gull a fright!<NL>How come you can understand me?
Well, never mind! It's just nice to have someone to unbirden myself to. Here, take this! One good tern deserves another, eh!
Th-Thanks!
Gullad to be of service!
Huh? It's a page from the <color:#1>Wizard's Companion</color>...for a spell called "<color:#8>Levitate</color>"!
Why would a seagull be carrying a spell that<NL>makes you float?
It's obvious, en't it?
...He likes a bit of light reading!!!<NL>BOOM BOOM!
Jeepers...
Gaaah! That kind of joke should be illegull...
...Eh?<NL>Will someone please tell me what is occurring?
Eh? What's all this, then?
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!
The Cavity Club's over towards the forest, Ollie-boy. I hope someone down there's funny enough to crack Mam up...
Flipping heck, mun! Mam's such a pain in the flipping neck! Flip!
Mam's as unchanging as the hills, mun. She IS a flipping hill! Bet she surprised the life out of you the first time you saw her, eh?
If we get all them pieces of art together, we should be able to make Mam laugh no problems, mun.
Righto! Eight pieces of art to gather, en't it? Let's help my butties on the road back to funny town!
Try asking some of the boys down the shops, en't it? There must be a few pieces of art kicking about down by there.
Tidy! Time to hand the pieces of art over to Smiley 'n' Surly, en't it?
To the Cavity Club! Smiley 'n' Surly await!
Thank crikey! Now my faithful apprentices won't have to retire from the funny business!
Righto! Time to make Mam laugh! You ready to split her mountainsides?
When youer ready, just go and talk to Smiley 'n' Surly, en't it?
Can't wait to see what Smiley 'n' Surly's new material's like, mun. It'd better be good, or I'll have their flipping guts for garters...
She laughed, mun! She flipping laughed! Quick, Ollie-boy! Onward! Into Mummy's tummy!
Hurry up, mun! Before she shuts her massive great big gob again!
She's laughing fit to burst, mun! Smiley 'n' Surly came good in the end! 'Course, being my apprentices, I always knew they would...
We've got some unfinished business back inside my mam, mun!
We need to go and help those littlies!<NL>Pronto!
Come on, there's a slide in my mam's tum just waiting for us to go down it!
It's off to see the Empire, the wonderful Empire of Hamelin! In Autumnia!
Let's hurry up and get ouerselves to Hamelin, shall we?
D'you see any sages round by here?<NL>I flipping don't!
Reckon youer going to get some Hamelin armor round by here, do you? Well I flipping don't!
Oi, what do you think youer doing, ditching youer piggy armor and running off?
What exactly does this have to do with sneaking ouer way into the palace in Hamelin, hm?
Come on, mun! We need to get to Hamelin and find ouerselves some belief, en't it?
You scared of hard work or something?<NL>We need to go and find the flipping princes!
Let's get these boys back to the palace in Hamelin, shall we?
The Tombstone Trail's s'posed to be over to the north of Hamelin, en't it?
We can't get back to ouer own time till we get that wand from over by the Tombstone Trail, mun.
Don't we need to be trying to find the right spell to get past that skeleton over on the Tombstone Trail?
Time to head back to the palace in Hamelin!<NL>These princes need dropping off, en't it?

Let's go and visit that Denny boy's house, shall we?
Here, what about old Pirateface? He's well full of himself! It's got to be worth a try, at least...
We'd best deliver that piece of heart while it's still fresh, eh? Don't want it going all stinky, do we?
Fancy a trip to Leila's shop to see how old Myrtle's getting on? I do!
Proper worried about Tengri, I am!
It's dragon-riding time, mun!<NL>Let's find that Solitary Isle, shall we?
We need to find old Kublai, mun!

That ceremony over in Perdida's starting soon, mun.<NL>We'd best get a move on!
Old puppy-eyes has got more than his fair share of love.<NL>I reckon he could spare us a bit of it!
Khulan needs a dose of love, en't it?
I reckon we should go and get Khulan to sort out Mornstar for us, don't you?
To Al Mamoon! Holy wood or bust!
Look at it, all sparkly and shiny!<NL>It's no normal lump of wood, is it?
The holy wood got nicked in Ding Dong Dell.<NL>We're going to lose the scent, hanging round here.
The thief's bound to be hiding in Ding Dong Dell, the rotter!
Let's go see Phil in Motorville!<NL>Er...brill!
Come on, Ollie-boy! Phil's youer mate, en't he?<NL>We need to help the pooer lad out!
Let's track down that pipsqueak, Pip, shall we?<NL>See if he's undergone some kind of change.
We need to get that holy wood back off the cheeky little blighter.
Righto, let's head over and see Marcassin so we can get this Clarion completed, shall we?
So we need to go to the Miasma Marshes and play the Clarion, en't it? Then it's just one more step to Nevermore...
There's only the Miasma Marshes left to cross, mun! Then it's Nevermore, and no looking back!
Not long now till the final showdown with Shadar, eh? You ready? I'm flipping bricking it, mun!
So it's just Shadar left to fight, eh?<NL>S'pose I'm ready as I'll ever be...<NL>Nevermore, here we come!
Let's go and let old King Tom know the score, shall we?
I hear they're organizing a knees-up in Ding Dong Dell. Let's go and see old King Tom, shall we?
Don't you need to head back to youer world and find that Pea? I can't see her myself, but I get the feeling she's important, like...

Is there anywhere left in ouer world you've not visited yet? Fancy doing a spot of sightseeing?
What's the matter, mun? You feeling a bit aimless now, is it?<NL>Don't worry, I reckon there's still plenty to do...
Reckon you've found everything there is to find in this world, do you? Well don't be so sure! Why not check youer Wizard's Companion?
Let's hop up on Tengri's broad old back and get searching for Nazcaä, shall we?
There's a clue somewhere in that Nazcaä place, mun, I'm sure of it.
All aboard the Iron Wyvern!<NL>It's time to give that White Witch what for!
You need to go and look for that Cassiopeia up in her castle, mun.
Reckon it's about time we went and saw the White Witch up at her castle, eh?
It's proper flipping busy round by here! Must be because there's a celebrity in town, eh? What do you mean "who?" Me, of course!
I wouldn't be where I am today without my fellow fairies, mun. They may be pillocks, but they're my pillocks! Lovely pillocky pillocks!
The Cavity Club's where the greatest acts of all time cut their teeth. People come from all over to get a glimpse of that stage. Legendary, it is!
What's that glint in youer eye? Youer wondering if you can use fairies as familiars, en't you? Sick, you are, mun! Sick!
I don't have to go and see my mam, do I? Gets my goat something rotten, she does! She just goes on and on... Oi! What's that look for!?
Let's get a move on, shall we?<NL>I'm bored out of my flipping skull, mun!
Let's start the new day as we mean to go on, shall we? Best foot forward, and last one in's a rotten egg!
Flipping heck, mun! Proper knackered, I am!
Lay off for a bit, will you? Even us fairies need a bit of time to ouerselves now and again...
Want me to say something, do you? Sorry, mun, I got nothing for you. Not a sausage. Nada. Diddly-squat. Zero. Er...zilch.
You should have a read of youer Wizard's Companion once in a while, mun. It's the wizardly thing to do.
Give over, mun! Stop staring at me like that!<NL>Youer giving me the flipping willies!
What is it? Did you want to ask me something? Spit it out, mun! I'm no good at guessing games!
Fancy a race, Ollie-boy?<NL>I'm faster than I look, en't it!
I don't know what it is you want me to tell you, mun, but I'm afraid I can't help you.

Is this...?
Youer flipping joking, mun!
...Motorville!?
Hey, en't that the Conductor over by there?<NL>Let's get after him and find out what's going on!
"...Buh-dom-bom-bom!<NL>Call my city Motorville, tell you why,<NL>'cause it's got motors up to the sky..."
This en't the Motorville we know and love, mun! There's something funny going on by here... Are we dreaming or something!?
Dreaming!? Most certainly not!<NL>This world is as real as any other!
It's just a little...different from the ones you've visited!
So this Motorville is different from my Motorville...?
Haa haa! Exactly right, Oliver!<NL>Now, come with me. I'll show you around!
Come along! Let me show you around!
What do you think of this world, then, Oliver?
Well, it sure is different... I mean, I know all these people, but there's something about them that's not quite the same...
Hee hee! Didn't your fairy friend tell you?<NL>There are any number of parallel worlds out there!
Your world, his world...and so on.<NL>An infinite number!
Come on, Ollie-boy! That was one of the first things I said to you, mun! Don't tell me you weren't listening!
Oh! I didn't realize you were such an expert, little fairy. I must have misheard you when you said you thought you were dreaming... Well, never mind. On with the show!
"Parallel parallel, oh, para para para!<NL>Parallel parallel, oh, para para para!<NL>Parallel. POP! Buh-dom-bom-bom..."
Time for a moment's respite, I think...<NL>So tell me, Oliver, are you getting used to this world?
Yeah... It's just... Do I exist here?<NL>No one seems to know who I am...
Hee hee! How adorable! Of course you don't exist here. In this world, you were never born.
Huh...?
Hoo hoo! I'll tell you all about it very soon.<NL>But now it's time to carry on with the tour!
"...Buh-dom-bom-bom!<NL>Crazy how it thrills me, tell you why,<NL>'Cause in this town even pigs can fly!"
So, why was I never born in this world, Mr. Conductor?
Well... When your soul mate severed the connection between you, you were cast adrift in the space between worlds.
That's where you were when your mother saved you... When I say "your mother," I mean the Great Sage, of course. The one with all the spells.
But there are worlds where that did not happen... Worlds where you were not saved... Worlds where you were not born... And this is one of them.
A world where you weren't born, eh?<NL>Crikey...
So, uh... Why did you bring me to this world,<NL>Mr. Conductor?
Haa haa! Oh, you'll see! You'll soon see!<NL>But there's a very special shop we need to visit first.
I'm sure you know which one I mean...
"Little shop, little shop, oh, little little little!<NL>Little shop, little shop, oh, little little little!<NL>Little shop. POP! Buh-dom-bom-bom..."
Ah, Oliver! So good to see you again!
Now you've had a chance to look around, I'd be very interested to know what you think of this world...
Well... It's sorta goofy, and there's a ton of strange stuff going on, but...
...it's kinda fun, too!
...Fun? This place? Hmm...<NL>I've been to places that were less fun, I s'pose...
Well, well! Thank you for your kind words.<NL>I'm glad we have your seal of approval!
Uh..."we"?<NL>Is this...your world, then?
That's right.<NL>This is my world...probably.
Probably?
You remember what I said, don't you?<NL>About how you were never born in this world?
In this world, you weren't saved by your mother—you remained a floating soul...
But I found the place where all floating souls end up...
That's when I decided to go and see you in the other world. That's when I opened the door...
So, uh... Does this mean...?
That's right. I am you in this world.<NL>I am the you that was never saved by your mother.
I see...
Do you? I flipping don't...<NL>This is getting proper weird, this is...
Unlike me, you knew your mother.<NL>But even you couldn't save her in the end...
Still, you had a wonderful adventure!<NL>I'm quite jealous, I must say!
Mr. Conductor...
Hee hee! Don't look so glum, Oliver!<NL>It really doesn't suit you!
Now, I know I've already taken up too much of your time...
But there's one more thing I'd like to show you... After all you've been through, the least I can do is make your dream come true...
I do believe your adventure is about to start anew.<NL>Please, open the final door...
I thought I'd make your dream come true...<NL>Please, open the final door!
Oh! You want to return to your world, do you?
Well, do be sure to come again sometime.<NL>I'll be waiting for you by the door.
I'm sorry, Oliver.<NL>You can't use your <color:#8>Gateway</color> spell in this world.
My, what fine weather! I don't see how anybody could be downhearted on a day like today!
Myrtle's a good girl, but she could stand to be a little less of a tomboy. There's not a day goes by that she doesn't come home with a new bump or graze!
Well, hello there, dear!<NL>Say...I don't think I've seen you in here before.<NL>Are you from out of town?
Oh, you must be looking for Phil!<NL>Well, I don't think he's left yet.<NL>You can still catch him if you hurry!
I just finished my chores, and now I'm going to the park to play ball with my friends!
Do you want to come with us? I'm pitching!
Please, it is nearly time for one's afternoon repast!<NL>One must not be disturbed!
Grrruh!? Who are you!?<NL>Denny, there's some strange kid here!
And he looks like a real momma's boy!<NL>Grrrahahahaharrr!
Geez, boy! Give them a break, will you?<NL>Sorry, you guys—Genghis here needs to learn some manners.
Well, now, this paint job is pretty swell, don't you think? Just like a juicy blue apple!
Huh? Apples are green? What are you talking about!? They're blue! Always have been!
My boy told me that Phil's been doing a lot of sneaking around lately.
I just hope he's not up to no good...
Huh? Myrtle? Sure, we go to school together.<NL>She's the best! Nice as pie, and a good sport, too!
She's working in Leila's store right now, but she promised me we'd go play ball when she finishes.
Hey, what are you guys up to?<NL>Can I join in?
You know why Leila won't sell any cheese in her store, don't you?
It's because she hates the stuff!<NL>I guess it's the smell...
Good morning, dear!<NL>Do I know you?
My nephew won't stop talking about that new car they're advertising everywhere. He says it flies even faster than the last one.
I heard Mrs. Woodford's husband is thinking of buying the new Coupe D-Lux...
It's all right for some, I guess!
Say, you got the time, kid?<NL>I'm thinking of taking my lunch break.
Waaait a second! Did you get that watch at the joke store? It's going backward! You kids!
Where would we be without good old gasoline, huh!?
I took my wife out for a drive on the weekend.<NL>Just a little trip into the sea, you know?
Had a real nice time of it, too. Birds in the water, fish in the sky—what more could you ask for?
Hmm... Have I forgotten something?<NL>I guess not... Or have I...?<NL>Oh shoot! Now I'm late!
It seems all the clocks have gone on strike today...
But my stomach always lets me know what time it is!<NL>It's the best timepiece in town!
This town's full of honest, hardworking people, kid. Listen to your mom and you'll grow up to be just the same.
Cats sure do love cheese, huh? They don't seem to like eating fish, though. I just don't get it...
You know, this is the first day off I've had in weeks. I think I'll go to the diner and get myself an extra-thick shake!
Y'know, each time I take a nap in the town square, I have a dream about this weird rabbit...
I often take my family for a walk in the town square on a Sunday. It sure is nice there in the shade of the trees.
The trees in the square love to take a walk.<NL>When they decide to go together, there's no shade at all.
And they always stand in a different place when they come back, too. That's why the square never looks<NL>the same.
I bought some real nice ham this morning.<NL>I can't wait till lunchtime!
Oh shoot! I need to get some bread from Leila's store! You can't make sandwiches without bread!
Ah, I'd love to drive one of those new automobiles. I can just imagine it—weaving through the sky, watching the fish fly by!
Oh my, those potatoes are cheap.<NL>I guess I'll make some fries for my grandchildren...
Hey! Don't you look at the signal when you're crossing<NL>the street!?
Green means stop, red means go, dummy!
H-Hey! Where's my car gone...!?
Oh yeah. I walked here.<NL>I guess I'm not used to leaving the car at home...
That house has furniture and all, but nobody's lived there in a long time...
I wonder where the owner's gone?
Say, do you know what time the diner opens?
Oh, hey there, kid!<NL>Take care crossing the street, you hear!
It's easy to forget that automobiles have feelings.<NL>We should be nicer to them.
If ours ever decided to run away...well, it doesn't bear thinking about.
Sorry to call you out so early in the morning.<NL>I guess I'll have to buy a new car soon...
These old cars start driving off by themselves after a while.
Be sure to lock your garage every evening, Ma'am.
If you have any more trouble, just give me a shout, okay?
It's going to rain this afternoon.<NL>That's what my cat said, anyway, and she's never wrong.
I've seen that rabbit a few times now...<NL>I guess the circus must be in town, huh?
Now, you be careful, son!<NL>There's lots of cars around here!
Rusty's such a stand-up guy. And friendly too. Whenever folks drop their cars off at the shop, he always has a smile for them.
You know anything about cars?<NL>Nah, I guess not. You're just a kid.
Hmm... I heard it's a machine that sends messages to another world...
I'm telling you, kid, fixing cars is a tough job.<NL>Put one screw in the wrong place and the whole thing stops working.
The house next door's been empty for years...
Oh, good morning.
This poor tree's lost so many branches. I wonder what could have happened?
Really? I heard it was a piece of a flying saucer that crashed near town!
Geez, would you look at the price of gas these days! I mean, twenty cents a gallon!? How am I supposed to afford that?
My car's a straight shift, not one of those fancy new manuals. They have a whole extra pedal!
Would you look at this weather!<NL>It's days like these that make me glad I went for a convertible!
I was actually planning on heading home and hanging some clothes out to dry...
But Rover says he heard the Johnsons' cat talking about how it was going to rain later.
I guess they're foreign-made, huh...
My husband's just bought a new car.<NL>A "Coop," or something like that.<NL>I hope it's got plenty of space in the trunk...
Hang on a mo—something en't right here. This en't the Motorville we know and love, Ollie-boy. It's somewhere...different.
Let's go and see that Conductor, shall we?
Chasing a white rabbit into a curious other world? I could swear I've read something like this before, mun. I wonder where...
Look at the traffic lights, Ollie-boy—they're yellow! Didn't they used to be red? There's peculiar...
Is this a dream or what, mun? It's proper weird whatever it is...

Leila's errand boy, Philip, calls out to Oliver as he leaves the store. It seems he has something important to tell him...
Phil tells Oliver that she's finally finished—and that tonight they're taking her for a spin! But first Oliver must head home with his mother's groceries!
It's finally time to take her for a spin...<NL>With his mother fast asleep, Oliver sneaks out and heads for Phil's garage!
After spending three days crying for his mother, a stray tear brings Oliver's doll, Mr. Drippy, to life! Having heard what the fairy has to say, Oliver agrees to accompany him to another world. But first he'll need to find a spellbook!
Ably guided by Mr. Drippy, Oliver finds the spellbook known as the Wizard's Companion hidden in the fireplace! If he's to use magic, however, he'll also need to find himself a wand—or a stick, at the very least!
While out looking for a wand, Oliver meets a mysterious little girl. Though she promptly disappears, Oliver finds an old stick near the place she was standing. Wand in hand, it's time to go and cast the Gateway spell!
Oliver casts Gateway, and is transported to another world! The first thing he needs to do is get hold of a real wand—perhaps he'll find one in Ding Dong Dell!
One of the guards at the gates of Ding Dong Dell has had a piece of his heart stolen, rendering him brokenhearted... Seeking advice on how to restore him to normal, Oliver heads for the Deep Dark Wood!
Old Father Oak teaches Oliver a spell that allows him to summon a familiar from his heart. He then informs our heroes that something strange has happened to the Guardian of the Woods, and asks them to restore him to normal!
Having restored the Guardian of the Woods to normal, Oliver receives the Locket from Old Father Oak, who teaches him how to give and take heart pieces. Oliver now has the means to mend the gate guard's broken heart!
Having repaired the gatekeeper's broken heart, Oliver and Mr. Drippy finally enter Ding Dong Dell, and head for the castle in search of a new wand!
Oliver and Mr. Drippy try to enter the castle, only to find that the King's favorite fish has gone missing, and that no one is allowed in until it is found! The pair have no choice but to start searching...
King Tom is brokenhearted as well! And he's lacking enthusiasm, just like his gatekeeper before him. Oliver must use his Locket to find someone with enthusiasm to spare!
King Tom's heart is complete once more...but now he's gone missing! Thinking that the King's soul mate Timmy Toldrum may hold some clue as to his whereabouts, Oliver heads back to Motorville!
Having found Timmy the cat hunting mice back in Motorville, Oliver learns that Ding Dong Well is infested with rodents. Might this be where the King has gone? There's only one way to find out!
Our heroes find the missing monarch locked in battle with Hickory Dock. After defeating the mischievous mouse and rescuing the King, Oliver is rewarded with a wand! Next up, Al Mamoon, where a Great Sage awaits!
Having made their way through Golden Grove, Oliver and Mr. Drippy arrive in Al Mamoon, home of the Great Sage Rashaad. Time to start looking for him!
Rashaad's daughter is brokenhearted, and the Great Sage has forsaken magic in his despair! Time to head back to Motorville and save Esther's soul mate!
Oliver saves Myrtle in Motorville, and is befriended by Esther as a result! On Rashaad's recommendation, our heroes then decide to head for the Temple of Trials to undertake the fabled sagely tests.
Having passed the tests with flying colors, Oliver and his friends are alerted to the fact that Old Smoky is about to blow, endangering Al Mamoon! With no time to spare, the party head for the summit of the volcano!
Oliver and his friends successfully prevent Old Smoky from erupting, saving Al Mamoon in the process. Their next port of call is the city of Hamelin, where another Great Sage awaits. But first, they'll need to find themselves a boat!
After a brief altercation with a common thief, Oliver and friends acquire a cauldron, and meet the genie who resides within it. They also learn that they cannot board a ship without a letter of passage... Back to Al Mamoon!
After learning that she shares a soul with Miss Leila, Oliver and friends restore the brokenhearted Cowlipha's restraint. In return, they receive a letter of passage... Castaway Cove awaits once more!
Upon arriving in Castaway Cove, the party have the portrait and letter of passage stolen by an incorrigible thief—who turns out to be lacking restraint! It's up to Oliver to restore him to normal!
The thief's name is Swaine, and he agrees to join Oliver and the others on their journey. The next Great Sage is said to be in Hamelin, on the eastern continent of Autumnia. Time to unfurl the sails!
The Eye of the Storm, summoned by Shadar himself, deposits our heroes on a seemingly uninhabited island...which turns out to be the home of the fairies! Oliver and co resolve to have a look around...
To find out why the littlies aren't being born, Oliver and his friends must venture into Mummy's Tummy... But Smiley and Surly's material just isn't making her laugh! Time to find their missing pieces of art!
Smiley and Surly's new routine gets a big laugh from the Fairy Godmother, allowing our heroes to jump inside—where they find the littlies are being attacked by terrifying monsters! Time to save the day!
With the littlies safely born, all is well in the Fairyground. Having seen how much he is missed, Oliver decides to leave Mr. Drippy on the island...but his fairy friend is having none of it! Reunited once more, they set sail for Autumnia!
Oliver and co finally make it to Hamelin—a sprawling city governed by countless draconian decrees. Believing the Great Sage to be somewhere in the Prince's palace, the party don disguises and attempt to sneak inside.
Having been thrown out of the brokenhearted prince's chambers, Oliver and his friends are engulfed in a strange mist that sends them back through time. In the Hamelin of the past, two princes are in need of their help!
In order to return to their own time, our heroes must find the wand called Mornstar and the spell known as Breach Time. It seems both are sealed away at the end of the perilous Tombstone Trail...
Oliver and co head to the end of the Tombstone Trail with the two princes in tow. There, Marcassin reveals his magical talent by defeating Mornstar's keeper. The wand and Breach Time safely in hand, it's time return to the future!
After saying their good-byes and returning to the present, Oliver sets about restoring Marcassin's lost confidence. With the Emperor's heart complete once more, the party set out in search of Kublai Khan and the stolen map!
Kublai takes a shine to Oliver, and shows him the Map of the Stones. Alas, the location marked on it can only be accessed by riding on the back of Tengri, a dragon who has unaccountably lost the power of flight!
Tengri's soul mate is Denny, a promising young athlete from Motorville. Mending the boy's broken heart allows the dragon to fly once more, and the party head for the remote island marked on the Map of the Stones!
The island marked on the map is home to a large monument...but no magic stones. Fortunately, Oliver is able to cast a spell to reveal their true locations, and the party set out to retrieve them!
Despite being in possession of all three stones, Oliver and friends are unable to restore Mornstar's full power. They decide to go and show the wand to Marcassin, in case he has any insight to offer...
The final Great Sage, Khulan, once ruled over the airborne kingdom of Xanadu. Though Xanadu is no more, rumor has it that Khulan herself is still alive. It's time to find the Queen of the Heavens!
Having been freed of Shadar's control, the brokenhearted Khulan is cured by the love in Kublai's heart, and restores Mornstar's true power. Next up, the party must craft the fabled Clarion, instrument of peace!
The holy wood needed to make the Clarion has been stolen by Pip—a mouse who shares a soul with Oliver's best friend Phil. Time to head to Motorville for a joyous reunion!
After mending Phil's broken heart, Oliver recovers the holy wood and takes it to King Tom, who begins to carve the Clarion. Now, it's off to Hamelin to apply the finishing touches!
After Marcassin and Swaine work together to complete the Clarion, our heroes travel to the Miasma Marshes. There, Esther uses the legendary instrument to clear a path to Nevermore, where the Dark Djinn awaits...
Upon learning the tragic truth about his mother, Oliver loses the will to carry on, but his strength is restored when Pea shows him all the people he's helped. It's finally time to take on the Dark Djinn!
It seems Lucien—who took the name Shadar—wanted to protect the world, not destroy it. Inspired by his dream, Oliver and his friends set out to bring about a new era of peace and happiness!
White ash has fallen from the sky, turning people into twisted monsters. Perhaps Pea, who appeared in Oliver's dream, has some idea of what to do. She should be in Motorville...
As soon as Oliver and the others return from Motorville, ash starts falling on the deck of the Iron Wyvern! Pea, however, knows a spell that can counteract its effects—a spell that can save the world!
With the help of Pea's magic, our heroes save the ash-affected cities. Pea then presents them with flowers that contain her memories of Nazcaä, and the party decide to head there without further delay.
Oliver and his friends now know the tragic truth about the White Witch's origins. The cycle of destruction cannot be allowed to continue. The world must join forces and stand as one!
Oliver and his friends have made it into the Ivory Tower, where the White Witch awaits. It's time for one last battle—to decide Cassiopeia's fate, and the fate of the world.

So youer just planning on leaving<NL>pooer old frog-face in the lurch,<NL>are you? There's heroic.
Rarebit! RRRarebit! RRRarebit!<NL>(Youer hopping off that way without<NL>changing back, are you? Well I'm not!)
